# Google Chrome

The browser we deserve, even if it depletes our laptop batteries faster
than a compiler. And if you haven't played with Web Inspector in recent
years. Hit that `Command` + `Option` + `i` right now.

I still use Safari (for speed and efficiency), Firefox, and Tor in
appropriate scenarios but I still default to Chrome for development.
