# [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)

macOS has very good battery preservation features, but sometimes you
don't want that screen to automatically dim after just few seconds when
you're not typing anything or moving the cursor.

Amphetamine -- though unfortunately named -- is a spirital successor to the patchily 
maintained Caffeine app which solves that very simple problem, with one click. 
And it makes you wonder how so many years later, Apple still hasn't made that a stock
feature.
