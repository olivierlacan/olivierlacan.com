OS X has very good battery preservation features, but sometimes you don't want that screen to automatically dim after just few seconds when you're not typing anything or moving the cursor. 

Caffeine solves that very simple problem, with one click. And it makes you wonder how so many years later, Apple still hasn't made that a stock feature.
