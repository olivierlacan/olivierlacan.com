Email is unsafe, it's a harsh realization that took way too long to hit
the mainstream. And I'm not sure most people fully understand that email
is just plain text and that it is sent over Wi-Fi networks as plain
text, which means that anybody who can snoop (by simply being connected
to the same network while you send or receive) your network can
litterally read your emails.

If you've ever sent a password or sensitive information to your co-
workers or to your family via email, you should assume that data could
have been accessed. It might be chilling, but it's basically as secure
as snail mail, which you left in a mailbox for hours before it was
picked up by a post office worker whose trustworthiness you took for
granted. Your letters were then transfered to a distribution center with
varied levels of security and surveillance, within which prying eyes
could very well have looked at your private communications.

GPGTools allows you to seamlessly encrypt and decrypt email messages
within Apple's Mail.app with people you trust by using a private &
public key pair just like Git does. It will encrypt your messages with
your trusted contact's public key so that only they can decrypt them
using their private key. Likewise, the other way around. Your contacts
will be able to send you encrypted messages using your public key.

You can publicly share your public key (as [I do](/about)) as long as
you can trust that someone won't swap it for a malicious key, so make
sure you trust the medium â€” your own site if it's secure or publication
platform that offers two-factor authentication.

Make sure to read [GPGTools' Quickstart
Guide](http://support.gpgtools.org/kb/how-to/first-steps-where-do-i
-start-where-do-i-begin) after you install the suite. They're planning
on improving the GPG Keychain Access app in the near future and revamp
this guide but it remains the best place to get started for now.

Mail.app's user interface is leagues behind that of Airmail. As long as
you have to sensitive information to discuss or credentials to share, I
would recommend sticking with Airmail for most email jobs.
