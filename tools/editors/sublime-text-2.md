# [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
After a bumpy transitioning period away from TextMate and Espresso, I tried Vim with the extremely helpful  [Janus bundle](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) created by [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) & [Carl Lerche](https://github.com/carllerche). But as a user interface designer, Vim still rubbed me the wrong way, it's a powerful beast when used with keyboard controls only, but a much clumsier one when some mousing is required. 

So I found my way on Sublime, which now has a [Vintage mode](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html) like Vim, but also a [command line utility](https://gist.github.com/1195304), [TextMate bundle compatibility](https://gist.github.com/1245956), and relatively simple [preference settings](https://gist.github.com/1149379).
