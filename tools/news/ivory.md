# [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/mac/) & [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)
I used Tweetbot feverishly on [OS X](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/) and [iOS](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) in the past. Twitter (RIP) was a mostly a professional/friendship tool for me. I followed a very small amount of high quality sources, never more than 300 or so people.

This allowed me to let people I trust
filter the news that are relevant to them, and by extension to me.

I've followed the same approach on my own Mastodon community: [ruby.social](https://ruby.social/olivierlacan). It's great for me but it centers around Ruby programmers so 
it's probably best you check out the Mastodon site to [find community servers](https://joinmastodon.org/servers) that cater to your own interests.
