# [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/)
For a long time I used TimeTrack Pro but I ended up abandoning passing
time tracking for a while because I was paid hourly and needed to be a
bit more precise with my time calculation for invoicing.

Recently though I switch to Qbserve which is a fantastic passive time
tracker that helps you notice when you're too distracted. It will
notify you when you've spent more than X amount of time being distracted
. This is determined by classifying (automatically with manual
overrides) the apps and websites you use.

Yes, it does mean that I'm letting an app track what I'm doing.
Thankfully this app is not networked so I don't have to worry about
my in-machine activity being logged somewhere I wouldn't want it to be.

I like the simple reports it gives me about how productive I was overall
in a given day, week, or month.
