title: About
---
I've been a self-taught web designer for over 10 years</span> and I've evolved into a software engineer over the last 4 years. Despite my unescapable Frenchness, my favorite languages are English and [Ruby](http://tryruby.org). I spend most of my time building and maintaining [large](https://codeschool.com) and small Rails applications.

I maintain and build features on [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s
Internal team. In the past I've written and participated in the development
of several of our courses. More on that [here](/work).

It's been mathematically proven that I [tweet](http://twitter.com/olivierlacan)
about as often as I breathe. I also [take little square pictures of the world](http://instagram.com/olivierlacan).

## Contact

If you'd like to email me securely you can use my [PGP Key](http://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?search=hi%40olivierlacan.com&fingerprint=on&op=index) and I recommend reading my little [GPGTools](/tools/security/gpgtools.html) article if you don't know much about secure communication. [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/olivierlacan) is a neat alternative with a much easier learning curve although it may not be as secure.
