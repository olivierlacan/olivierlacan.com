I've been creating websites for over {{ websitesYears }} years
and I've evolved into a more backend focused software developer during
the last {{ programmingYears }} years. Despite my unescapable
Frenchness, my favorite languages are English and
[Ruby](http://tryruby.org).

I spend most of my time building and maintaining
[large](https://codeschool.com) and small Rails applications.

I've built and maintained [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com) for
multiple years. I've written and participated in the development of
several of our earliest courses. More on that [here](/work).

I've created the Shields metadata [badges](http://shields.io) that
you can now find in [open source repositories][gh-shields] all over to
succinctly display whether tests are passing or failing, if dependencies
are out of date, or if code is well-documented or not.

I wrote [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com) to give fellow
software developers clearer guidelines on how to providing
human-friendly release notes for their software.

I've spoken at multiple conferences around the world on topics like
Science-driven Development, contributing to open source, Ruby on Rails,
and information security. You can find my published talks [here](/talks).

If you'd like to email me securely you can use my [PGP Key][pgp] (see
[GPGTools][gpg]). [Keybase.io][kb] is a neat alternative with a much
easier learning curve although it may not be as secure.
