*I originally drafted this post on August 22nd, 2013, barely a year and
a half into my now seven-year tenure at my current job. It's a little
strange how the feelings I expressed in the draft have solidified over
the years and have been amplified by the rise of bootcamps which had to
exist in order to fill the debatably dire lack of newcommers in the
software industry. It's a little strange to me that something I wrote
in frustration over the industry's obsession with seniority over 6 years
ago still feels so relevant.*

- Why don't you start from scratch more often?
= Why is it about the impact of someone leaving your team so harsh on
  your team's productivity?
- Why does it taste so bitter when someone jumps into your project and
  changes a lot of things?
- Why do you always spend more time than you thought onboarding someone
  who recently joined you team?

Information.

No matter how smart and passionate your co-workers are, information
transfer will always be limited in bandwidth. When you join a team,
depending on how humble and curious you are, your bandwidth for new
information is at its peak. You listen intently, you tread carefully,
you ask as many questions as you can get away with before annoying your
new teammates.

You're also free of all the assumptions and biases that the team you
joined has developed over time. Their habits may be justified, but if
you're anything like me your tolerance for inefficiency is at its
minimum because you know that human beings have a tendency to become
blind to tedious work if they have done it often enough and it just
works.

You frustrate more easily too because there is no such thing as the
status quo for you yet. Whether you have experience or not, you feel
like a newcomer (*junior* is so fucking condescending). Unbeknownst to
you, and possibly your teammates, you're more useful to them than you
will be for a while. You may seem inexperience, but that inexperience in
itself is incredibly valuable.

This is why it bothers me so much when I see job postings stiffly
requiring 3 or 5+ years of experience or "senior" levels for every
single position to be filled. I don't deny that there is a difference
between someone with or without prior experience. Experience has benefits
but we often ignore its drawbacks. Someone who grows into a team
will often be far more invested than someone who's been around the block
and knows they can keep hoping jobs. It of course depends on many factors
but if you treat newcomers right, it will make sense for them to grow
with your team unless they're hungry for new challenges.

It's often a game of incentives and perspective. With limited
perspective and limited experience, the noise of other opportunities is
reduced and the weight of the past doesn't hinder inititiative. If what
I'm describing sounds a lot like foolishness and insularity, that's
because it is. You need weathered adventurers who've broken one too many
ribs against avoidalbe hurdles throughout their careers but you also
need overly enthusiastic sidekicks who can't wait to jump off of cliffs.
Given the right environment (hint: psychological safety) these two types
of teammates will complement each other and challenge each others'
assumptions in a healthy way.

Information about a system is a rare commodity for an enthusiastic
newcomer. They cherish what little they have and are eager to discover
more in order to unrderstand how more of the system really works.
They're also in a better position to share it with others because
research shows that freshly acquired information is easier to transfer.
It's also easier to relate to the hurdles of people who ignore something
you recently ignored yourself. On the contrary, when your brain is
filled with thousands of pieces of information about your team, its
inner workings, how specific processes work and why something is
designed in a counter-intuitive way, when you swim in information, it
doesn't feel as valuable. Of course, it is.

Every time someone asks you a question. You should stop to think whether
it's something you've answered at least once before and whether this
information exists somewhere tangible where anyone else could discover
it organically. Otherwise, you've wasted your own time by hoarding
information that is valuable to everybody. Sure, it makes you invaluable
as the repository of arcane knowledge. It's also likely to negatively
affect your ability to focus because being the sole knower of things
means the number of people interrupting you to get answers will grow
as your team grows. Additionally, answering questions about arcane parts
of a system doesn't really make for an exciting work life.

When I joined Envy Labs over seven years ago, before Code School even
was its own entity, I was overwhelmed with information. I browsed
through the source code of Code School and while I was more excited
about it than I've ever been since, my lack of knowledge about its inner
workings was annoying and hindering. I had to ask. I had to interrupt.
And I felt bad, because I know who difficult it is for creative people
to get back to their flow when interrupted by a question. This is something
too many so-called seniors forget about. The toll of asking.

Eventually though, my domain knowledge started expanding. Because I
spent so much time doing support, user accounts were quickly
demystified. We had a very simple administration system which was
limited enough that my co-worker [Adam](http://twitter.com/adamrensel)
and I spent a lot of time on the (production, oh yeah) console dealing
with stuff in a more straightforward fashion. We used GitHub wikis to
store information about specific things you couldn't easily figure out
by reading the source code or the comments.

After searching users by email often enough I made a quick little
TextExpander snippet that would take any email address in my clipboard
and turn it into `User.find_by_email(email@example.com)`. That might
seem silly, but I typed that stuff a lot.

We're a small team, so it's still rather rare for us to have to onboard
a new developer for Code School development. It sounds a little absurd
in these days of Docker overload, but I believe that when Adam and I had
to set up Code School on our own machines, it took us multiple days.
There were some instructions written in a wiki, but they were
incomplete, slightly out of date, or OS X wasn't enjoying one of our
dependencies.
