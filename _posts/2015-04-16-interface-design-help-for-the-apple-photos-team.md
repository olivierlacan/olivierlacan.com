As anyone with a more than 10,000 photos in their library can attest, the new
Apple Photos app — while pretty and fast on the surface — is a pile of software
engineering and design catastrophes.

Since I've been screwed by atrocious syncing settings two weeks ago, allow me to
take some vicious pleasure in ripping apart what I consider to be the absolute
worst part of the Photos interface: the settings.

The first time you open Photos, it's likely you'll see this at the bottom of the
`Photos` tab:

You'll surely appreciate the absolute minimalism of this interface. It's so
minimalistic you can't even tell if there's any progress at all; or stop the
upload if you're on a metered connection; or having any idea how to restart it
if it ever gets stuck (it will every other day).

So what do you do? Well, why not try the Settings. I'm sure that would be the
average user's obvious next step, right? No, I'm being fucking sarcastic. If you
leave it to users to figure out what your interface means and how to act on it
you fucking failed. Go home. Stop making software. Yes, this is mean. Yes, this
will make someone's day at Apple suck, maybe. But you know what? Photos has already
made dozens of my days suck.

I didn't love iPhoto. It was sluggish, designed for an audience with even fewer
photos in their library than Photos. Something I find unbelievable considering
the trove of shots most Apple users (iPhone owners) create every single day.
I'm sure Apple has better data to work with to know the average size of their
users's photo libraries — at least I hope, because it appears Photos was at least
partially designed to handle larger libraries.

Speaking of larger libraries, let's get back to the Settings.
