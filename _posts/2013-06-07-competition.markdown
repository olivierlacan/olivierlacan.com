A few years ago I was an avid listener of Penn Jillette's [Penn Radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Radio) show with Michael Goudeau â€“ a vegas juggler and staff writer on _Penn & Teller: Bullshit!_. On several episodes of the show Penn discussed the notion that performers like David Blaine or Criss Angel were competition to Penn & Teller's own show in Vegas. Penn found that notion quite short-sighted.

Most people freak out when they see a competitor who is portrayed in the media as _fresher_ and more _edgy_. It's a bit of a shock to the system. Suddenly, you're not the only cool venue in town anymore.

**You were never the only cool venue in town.**

Let's go back to Penn & Teller's competitors. First, the group of people who pay for a flight to Vegas and a ticket to see Penn & Teller doesn't necessarily overlap with the group of people who like to watch street magic on cable. The success of one doesn't have to come at the expense of the other.

Second --- and most importantly --- any mass media attention directed towards magic is beneficial to all magicians, especially established ones. As Penn puts it, if Magic pulls in big ratings on TV, you can bet ticket sales for Penn & Teller will get a nice boost as well. And this pattern has been reproduced, repeatedly.

The market for magic doesn't have a fixed size.

Now take the online education market. Mature isn't the first adjective that comes to mind, it's in a state of _gold rush_. It's true that several companies have existed in the space for a few years, but recently new interactive experiences have attracted a much broader audience. The incorporation of game mechanics has also allowed those services to sustain the interest of a new audience.

Sometimes people wonder if I'm worried about Code School or any other service being eclipsed by Khan Academy or bigger fishes. If there's a white board or a piece of paper nearby, I grab a marker, and I draw this:

Excuse the hyperbole, but not unlike the universe, the online education market is expanding, and knowing that billions more will discover the web in the next decade that growth is not about to slow down.

Let's say --- in the absence of solid data --- that [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.com) and [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) are the two larger circles (left and right) in term of mindshare, [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) and [Code School](http://codeschool.com) as the smaller circles (hindered by profitability), you can get a better idea of what I mean.

In a relatively stable market where each service is targetting similar groups of customers, competition might be a more serious concern.
