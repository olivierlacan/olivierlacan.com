![Keep a Changelog Badge][badge]

After years of small improvements and two years since the last minor release,
Keep a Changelog finally reached [version 1.0 today][1.0].

What's new? Well, [read the changelog!][changelog]

In short we have 6 new language translations, simplified version-aware language
navigation, much clearer and succinct sections that describe the [What][what],
[Why][why], and [Who][who] of changelogs, and a lot of refinements.

For people who like clear guidelines, there are now
[guiding principles][principles] that summarize the key components of good
changelogs. There's also a section about changelog [bad practices][bad]
to help your friendly maintainers understand that a git log dump doesn't
helping anyone.

Finally, we now document changelog maintenance details and edge cases in a neat
little FAQ section to avoid confusing everybody with specifics upfront.

I'd like to thank the incredibly talented Tyler Fortune for his work
on the new visual identity of the project. And of course, I'm incredibly
grateful to the many contributors who helped translate this project in 14
different languages.

You can see Tyler's incredible branding work [on his website][fortune].
His work allowed me to create the kind of strong and clear project
website I didn't have the courage to build back in May 2014 when this
project originally started.

PS: I'm [looking for help][gh] porting the following languages to this new
version: Czech, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portugese, Russian,
Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish, Simplified & Traditional Chinese, and any other
language you'd like to [contribute][lang].
