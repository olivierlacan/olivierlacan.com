Over the course of this past year I've been pairing a lot. I'm the only
full-time remote member of my team because governments are weird like that.

If you're a person of the web, when I say "pairing" you probably extrapolate
that to mean "pair programming". Nope. That's not what I said.

What I refer to as "pairing" has very little to do with the excruciating
ordeal that appears to be the norm at some elite consultancies. The one
where people spend a whole eight hours [ping pong programming](http://articles.coreyhaines.com/posts/thoughts-on-pair-programming/#ping-pong-pairing) until both human brains are depletted of all their joy. I'll
admit I probably have an overly negative vision of that one.

My kind pairing is much simpler than that. Much looser than that. It
takes a pair of people working together to achieve something or simply
to learn something from each other. Yes. There doesn't have to be an
explicit goal to the pairing. Such anarchy.

The way [John](https://twitter.com/jbalauat) and I pair works like this.
He'll ask me a pointed question which will require some thinking. He
won't rush me because beyond the answer. John is looking to understand
how I and people like me think. Whenever I have a chunk of free time
I'll hop on Screenhero with John so that he can see my screen or me his.
That's because just like you do in real life, when you talk to someone
you often want to show them things, examples, context, articles to read
and sites to visit. Through our conversations John and I will take
detours to talk about cognitive science because we both love that. It'll
never be a waste of our time because we're both learning from each other
along the way.

[Katie](https://twitter.com/katiedelfin) is a programmer like me yet we
probably only write code together 15% of the time. Most of the time we
talk about code. We talk about interfaces. How names feel. How things
fit together. We get excited about deleting huge chunks of code. We
pause while I try to paraphrase something brilliant she just said
because the world needs to know and therefore I must tweet it. Let me
linger on this one. We do not spend 100% of our time on task. Ever. If
you think that's a waste of valuable company time then you don't
understand that the most crucial pieces of the entire machine are the
relationships between the humans that keep it running. Knowing Katie
better, understanding how she things, what frustrates her, what she
cares about, what makes her lose sleep at night â€” that's how I can
design and develop a better interface to work with Katie to build
software for other human beings.

You can feel how much [Morgan](https://twitter.com/morganlaco) is bothered by not understanding something.
It's an audible noise sort of like [Tina's whine in Bob's Burgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_XaIuw6K6Q).
When she wants to understand something, at first I think:

> "Sure, I know how that works. We can take a short detour so I can explain that."

Then I realize:

> "Shit, actually I have no idea how that works. How the fuck have I never bothered to look into this."

So we pair.

I can use the accumulated system knowledge I have and, with
her, come to a satisfying solution faster. Perhaps because she doesn't
know yet where and what to look for. Yet, without her I would have never
looked. I owe her that fresh perspective. This renewed attention to
details that you often lose when so many things need fixing.

Joel coined the title of this post in our Slack channel after we
had a conversation about implicit versus explicit code. Instead of a
Computer Science background, Joel is a linguistics nerd like me so
together we defy the adage that the hardest thing for programmers is
naming things. That said, we sure talk about naming things a lot. And
when we pair, I spend a lot of time making Joel comfortable with the fact
that I have [no idea what I'm doing](http://themultilogue.com/episodes/3475-v0-0-3-no-idea-what-i-m-doing)
either. But we can figure it out together. What will benefit Joel from
pairing with me is discovering the connective tissue of my workflow that
you can't really learn by reading programming books. I liken it to the
colloquialisms and slang I learned from TV shows and my friends while I
was on my way to become billingual. It can't be taught, it can only
be experienced.

I'm skipping over several other forms of pairing because those are the
people I spend the most time pairing with. But make sure not to limit
yourself to pairing with people who have the same skillset you do. I've
learn and taught quite a bit when pairing with people who do customer
support, marketing, front-end development, design, or even other programmers
who [use a programming language & framework I'm unfamiliar with](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/knowledge-vs-intelligence).

Over the course of this year my sheer output of code has sharply
decreased. I've become more of a [sherpa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people#Mountaineering).
A router from problem to person. From person to answer.

It's easy to worry about my productivity. Yet this is not a one-sided
deal. While I'm indeed lucky to spend so much time collaborating
with good people, pairing increases the total volume of knowledge of our
company. It makes us interact better with each other. It makes us
realize that we're all imperfect in many ways but that our strengths
interlock into a beautiful construct made of humans, thoughts and good
work.
