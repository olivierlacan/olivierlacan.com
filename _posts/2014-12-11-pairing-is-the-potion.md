The way [John](https://twitter.com/jbalauat) and I pair together works
like this. He'll ask me a pointed question which will require some
thinking. John won't rush me. Beyond the answer, he is looking to
understandingand how I and people like me think. Whenever I have a chunk
of free time I'll hop on Screenhero with John so that he can see my
screen or me his. That's because just like you do in real life, when you
talk to someone you often want to show them things, examples, context,
articles to read and sites to visit. Through our conversations John and
I will take detours to talk about cognitive science because we both love
that. It'll never be a waste of our time because we're both learning
from each other along the way.

[Katie](https://twitter.com/katiedelfin) is a programmer and a damn good
one. Yet we probably only write code together 15% of the time. Most of
the time we talk about code. We talk about interfaces. How names feel.
How things fit together. We get excited about deleting huge chunks of
code. We pause while I try to paraphrase something brilliant she just
said because the world needs to know. I must tweet it.

[Morgan](https://twitter.com/morganlaco) is bothered by not
understanding something. When she wants to understand, at first I think:
"Sure, I know how that works. We can take a short detour so I can
explain that.". Then I realize: "Shit, actually I have no idea how that
works. How the fuck have I never bothered to look into this?". So we
pair. I can use the accumulated system knowledge I have and, with her,
come to a satisfying solution faster. Perhaps because she doesn't know
yet where and what to look for. Yet, without her I would have never
looked. I owe her that fresh perspective. This renewed attention to
details that you often lose when so many things need fixing.

[Joel](https://twitter.com/joeltayl) is a linguistics nerd like me so
together we defy the adage that programmers suck at naming things.
That said, we sure talk about naming things a lot. And when we pair,
I spend a lot of time making Joel comfortable with the fact that I have
[no idea what I'm doing](http://themultilogue.com/episodes/3475-v0-0-3-no-idea-what-i-m-doing)
either. But we can figure it out together. What will benefit Joel from
pairing with me is discovering the connective tissue of my workflow that
you can't really learn by reading programming books. I liken it to the
colloquialisms and slang I learned from TV shows and my friends while I
was on my way to become billingual. It can't be taught, it can only be
experienced.

Knowing John, Katie, Morgan, and Joel better, understanding how they
think, what frustrates them, what they cares about, what makes them lose
sleep at night â€” that's how I can design and develop a better interface
to work with Katie to build software for other human beings.

My kind pairing is simple. It's loose. All it takes a pair of people
working together to achieve something or simply to learn something from
each other.

We do not spend 100% of our time on task. Ever. If you think that's a
waste of valuable company time then you don't understand that the most
crucial pieces of the entire machine are the relationships between the
humans that keep it running.
