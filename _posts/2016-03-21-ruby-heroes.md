For every (nice) Rubyist, this is the time of the year when you take a little
break from yak-shaving to think about the people who made your life and our
community better this past year.

I've just released the new [Ruby Heroes](http://rubyheroes.com/) website. It was
painful to get back to front-end development after all these years but hopefully
I've managed to do justice to [Cher Cloude's](https://dribbble.com/chercloude)
beautiful illustrations.
