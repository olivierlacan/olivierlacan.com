Knowing that something should be maintained or cleaned doesn't mean
you'll remember or want to maintain or clean it.

I think I could use software paradigms to explain this but it's good to
broaden the focus a bit, so let's talk about a machine that a lot of
people use or benefit from every day: the espresso machine.

More specifically the E61 group head. As its name suggest, it was
invented in 1961, nearly 60 years ago. You might think its ubiquity in
modern coffee machines might be due to nostalgia, but you'd be mistaken.
As a person who gets to pretend to be an engineer because that it sounds
cooler (and less dorky) to people nowadays than webmaster, I can tell
you that the E61 is actually impressive engineering.

The E61 group reliably delivers over 8 bars (116 psi) of pressure to the
puck of ground coffee lodged in the portafilter basket in order to do
what your instapot does to your stew: make something happen much faster
than it should be possible.

Espresso as a culture is without a doubt a micro-optimization to
literally squeeze every ounce of time and flavor out of a coffee brewing
process that wasn't really broken to begin with. The result *can be*
exceptional, or it can be terrible. That's because espresso brewing
takes the existing variables of brewing and makes any change to them
much more drastic. Coffee ground size, pressure, water temperature,
timing. A small change in any of these can result in a dramatically
different end result.

Which brings me to my definitely not expressly delivered point: cleaning
and maintenance. In filter coffee brewing slight changes in end-result
are often due to a change caused by the person brewing the coffee.
Because of the extreme conditions in which espresso is brewed, any
variation in the machine itself can have a much greater impact. This is
why espresso machine cleaning and maintenance is emphasized so much.

I know this.

I know that I need to flush my E61 group head before and after every
single shot. I know that I need to occasionally use a brush to dislodge
coffee grounds that end up stuck in the shower head above the ground
basket. I know that backflushing — an operation that is unique to the
design of the E61 group head — allows me to remove any oils that might
be stuck inside the system.

I do all of these things.

But there's one more thing that routinely needs to be done. And my brain
could not help but slowly lower its priority in the maintenance cycle
because I assumed it wouldn't have as much of an effect as all the other
variables.

I was wrong. But you saw that coming.

Over the past few months, the espresso I've been brewing has been
getting thinner and more bitter. And despite doing all the things I knew
I had to do. I didn't think of cleaning the part of the top of the
shower screen that releases water onto the coffee puck in my machine.
This requires using a flathead screwdriver to dislodge the screen which
is held in place by a rubber gasket and the screwing in of the
portafilter basket. After finally deciding to remove it last night, I
discovered a layer of caked in oily coffee deposits on the opposite side
of where the coffee grounds *should be*.

My mental model was faulty. I made an assumption that is probably only
valid in environments with low water pressure. Because of the high
pressure in this environments, coffee grounds and oil end up shooting
back through the components from which water shoots from. It weird and
unintuitive. But it's also something I had been warned to look out for.

Yet, I needed to screw up for the lesson to stick. And what a tasty lesson.
