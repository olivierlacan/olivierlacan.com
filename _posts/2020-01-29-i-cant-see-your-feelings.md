In the last decade, phone cameras have gone from noisy shots to DSLR-level quality, 
webcams have coasted on the mediocre lane. Remote work grew 91% over that same period 
of time. We’ve never relied on webcams more, and they still suck.

We share beautiful soft-focused selfies with our friends but we’re stuck with dark and 
blurry views of our co-workers faces. The faces we depend on to get work done. The 
Logitech C920, still The Wirecutter’s top pick, came out in January 2012 — **eight years ago**, 
the year of the chamfered-edged iPhone 5. 

I can’t fix hardware design for webcam manufacturers, but what I can do is give you tips 
to help your distributed co-workers interface with the most important tool next ot your 
finger tips: your highly expressive face.

## Point the light toward *you*

I can’t count the number of meetings I’ve been in where the main speaker, often someone 
important, decides to sit with a window behind them. A recipe for webcam disaster. 

Webcams use an average of the light ouput of a frame to determine how bright or dark 
exposure should be. When you sit in front of a bright daylight window, you’re turning 
yourself into a minority exposure sample because the majority of the frame is much brighter 
than you. So you end up looking incredibly dark.

Try this trick next time, turn on your webcam and then use your hands to block out the 
window’s light behind you. You’ll instantly see the exposure increase to brighten your face. 
Pretty cool, huh? Now never fucking sit in front of a goddamn window on a call ever again. 
Your coworkers will thank you.

Some days, or inside of dark offices, pointing a window *at* your face might not be an 
option. Try to find a bright desk lamp with a lampshade that can diffuse light so it’s 
not too harsh on your face. I use a simple double-bulb lamp with two 5.5 Watt LED soft 
white bulbs (2700 Kelvin) as a backup light source. If you can afford a higher webcam 
budget, the newer Razer Kiyo webcam has an adjustable LED light ring around it which 
provides incredible lighting. I wish more webcams offered this option. The improvement 
is staggering.  

## If you can’t zoom in, get closer

Your face matters. I know you might not *love* your face (therapy is priceless) but  
if you’re going to represent less than 50% of the total size of the webcam frame, 
you might as well turn that shit off and rely on your voice alone, or just type a 
fucking email with what you mean to say and send it to your team. 

Faces are incredible interfaces. I can tell you to fuck off with a smile and a mischievous 
twinkle in my eye. You’d instantly understand, granted we’ve established a rapport in 
which that’s an okay thing for me to do, that I meant no offense and instead am quite 
fond of you.

Now if I did that and you couldn’t quite make out my expression, or the intonation of my 
voice, we’d be in a much more tricky situation. 

I use a tiny macOS Menu Bar app called [Webcam Settings][1]. It’s not fancy, and it’s 
not free ($7.99), but it’s been worth it for me. It’s compatible with most webcams and 
allows you to dig into settings that your operating system or the camera itself sadly 
don’t expose. Things like white balance, brightness, saturation, but also (digital) zoom 
level and exposure time. You might be able to find alternative tools for your own OS, 
but if you can’t, try to find a way to bring that webcam closer to you. Screen-mounted 
webcams can only get so close, which is why zooming is such a good option in my mind.
