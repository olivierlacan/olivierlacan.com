# In the Rain Shadow

When I was a teenager growing up in northern Paris, there’s one night I remember distinctly: the first time I spent a whole night on the Internet. 

There was a mix of hope, awe, excitement, and lust for discovery I hadn’t realized I was missing. It felt like my mind’s compass was unshackled. 

A few years later I coaxed (hah!) my parents into buying a cable TV & broadband Internet bundle. I no longer had to worry about being disconnected if they used the phone line I had tapped into by drilling through a closet.

Things got worse. A foolish technology teacher (merci Monsieur Brahimi !) suggested everyone in my middle school senior’s class create a website focusing on something they loved. 

Microsoft FrontPage quickly felt limiting. Naturally, I “borrowed” a copy of Macromedia Dreamweaver 3 from the depth of the web. The obvious next step 
was to find text flame effects tutorial for Photoshop 5.5 (new feature: [“Save for Web”][1]). Glorious.

   behind the letter 'S'." 
   caption="Did you seriously think it *wasn’t* going to be Papyrus?!"

This rabbit hole went on forever. 

I made one version of the site for technology class, then worked for 
months on a new version (shockingly [still up][2]!). Then broadband 
Internet gave me the power to obtain whole TV shows whose episodes were 
months or years away from airing on French TV. 

Once an X-phile fan, I learned director David Nutter shot James Cameron's
new post-apocalyptic sci-fi show starring a then mostly unknown Jessica 
Alba (and John Savage!). No one knew about this! The desire to share 
felt too great: JamPonyXpress.com was born. 

I spent months building basic site functionality: 
episode guide, character sheets, photos, video & audio clips, links, and 
even a discussion forum! Then Saturday, September 1st 2001 the show aired 
for the first on French national TV (M6) and the measly dozens of visitors
I was getting daily exploded to over a thousand. That is, until the 
hosting company shut it down for exceeding monthly bandwidth usage. 

Most of the traffic was probably from people trying to figure out when
the next episode would air, but a surprising amount stuck around. I 
found myself having to moderate a community with hundreds of fans at the 
ripe old age of 16.

The show was eventually canceled after its second season but while 
maintaining the site and its community I got involved with a French 
non-profit dedicated to promoting tv shows as a legimate art form. At 
the time in France, most shows were routinely aired out of order, 
poorly dubbed, and — unless they were marquee big dramas like ER — 
treated like slighly more expensive soap operas. 

This happened to be a pivotal time. A few massive popular and 
critical hit shows arrived in 2003 and 2004: Desperate Housewives, 24,
Lost, Grey's Anatomy, House, . 

Reality TV was also surging in popularity all over the world. This 
made the grassroots work of legitimizing fictional TV shows much harder. 
But after a few years, French TV stations realized that co-producing 
feature films wasn't the only way they could contribute earn dedicated 
viewers for homegrown fiction. 

I ended up becoming the "webmaster" for a few different websites this 
non-profit produced or was associated with. The most ambitious one 
was created by a friendly chain-smoking teenager named Nicolas who 
cobbled together some wild PHP scripts to create TV-focused IMDb 
alternative (back when it also looked cobbled together).

I had virtually no exposure to programming at the time, but PHP was 
messy enough that simply writing some HTML markup and CSS stylesheets I 
was exposed to a some database connection and query logic here and there.

During my first patchy years in college, I kept slowly learning a bit 
more about website and graphic design. I vaguely remember learning  
about web standards from Jeffrey Zeldman and Eric Meyer's blogs. 

Through my non-profit work I ended up being introduced to well-known TV critic 
who freelanced for a few different print publications. Sensing the wave 
of critical and popular acclaim for TV shows in France, he convinced me 
to join his "newsroom" in the Paris suburbs to work on a new magazine 
entirely focused on the 8th art. Despite committing to 
at most 5 days per month in-between college classses, I ended up 
dropping out and working nearly full-time. 

I rationalized this for a while. After all, transcribing and translating 
interviews wasn't entirely alien to my English major. But it quickly 
impacted my social life as well. 

It's easier to accept being mostly paid in "exposure" when you practice 
your English talking to the creator of your favorite HBO show (Carnivàle) 
or the guy who played Highlander on TV when you were a kid. 

After half a year of this, I was exhausted and realized I was getting 
played so I cut back my time commitment. This led to the longest firing 
conversation I've ever experienced in my life. It was probably shorter 
but I remember spending three hours being told in multiple ways how 
unprofessional and uselesss I was, how he could do all of my work in 
half the time, and best of all how I'd never be able to hold a creative 
job in my life. Cherry on top, he had the gall to offer me a "no hard 
feelings" handshake after escorting me out of the building. 

To this day, I'm still proud of shaking my head and saying "non merci". 
That was one of the best professional decisions I had made in my life: 
don't ever let charismatic assholes exploit your passion for their own 
gain.

When I went back to college, it was a lot harder to complain about 
school work. I stuck it out for a few years. But unlike the journalism 
bug, the web one hadn't been squashed by my misadventures. It felt so 
antiquated to work so hard to produce paper, only to never see or hear 
anything from your readers.

The relatively small websites I worked on during those years had not 
only a captive audience, but entire communities or real people. Some of 
them never converted from forum username to real life, but a handful 
became my friends. Some of those community members dated, got married,
and even had kids. And this teenager web "guru" I was back then played 
some part in it. 

It's a wild feeling to when sharing something you results in connecting 
a bunch of stranger together. It makes the world feel a little smaller 
and friendlier. This fueled me a very long time.

When I figured out that becoming a teacher or a certified translater 
didn't spark that same joy, I started reluctantly considering turning 
my passion into a job. But "webmaster" was still barely a job in 2007, 
especially in France. Web design was too low brow for graphic design 
schools, and too fussy for computer science schools.
