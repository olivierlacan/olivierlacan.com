# In the Rain Shadow

When I was a teenager growing up in northern Paris, there’s one night I remember distinctly: the first time I spent a whole night on the Internet. 

There was a mix of hope, awe, excitement, and lust for discovery I hadn’t realized I was missing. It felt like my mind’s compass was unshackled. 

A few years later I coaxed (hah!) my parents into buying a cable TV & broadband Internet bundle. I no longer had to worry about being disconnected if they used the phone line I had tapped into by drilling through a closet.

Things got worse. A foolish technology teacher (merci Monsieur Brahimi !) suggested everyone in my middle school senior’s class create a website focusing on something they loved. 

Microsoft FrontPage quickly felt limiting, so I naturally “borrowed” a copy of Macromedia Dreamweaver 3. I went hard. Of course I found a tutorial on how to make flame effects in Photoshop 5.5 (which introduced [“Save for Web”][1]). Of *course* I paid full retail price to create this masterpiece. 

![Did you seriously think it *wasn’t* going to be Papyrus?!][2]
