This pandemic isn’t over. Before it even started, remote work was on the 
rise around the world. 

Why? Because it makes sense. Knowledge work doesn’t have to be 
centralized to crammed, loud, distracting, unhealthy open offices 
located in overly expensive areas. It also makes little sense for 
knowledge workers who work on laptop to bring that laptop to a room 
inside of a building they have to travel hours to and from every single 
day.

Instead, more people and their bosses choose to work remotely. I don’t 
use “Work From Home”  because it’s infused with butts-in-seats 
condescension perfected by corporate leaders. You’re not working, you’re 
“working from home”. Be grateful. We *let* you do that. It's a perk. 
They assume you'll be doing laundry, running errands, but not really 
"working". It's a semantic trap. Absent is any recognition that work 
is by nature remote when it happens on the Internet. Large companies 
have renote offices. They rely on asynchronous communication *in some 
way* to coordinate work across cities and countries.

The first thing inexperienced remote workers complained about when the 
pandemic led to a sudden exodus from shared offices spaces all over the 
world in the spring of 2020: it’s hard to communicate remotely. 

No shit.

It’s hard to communicate. Period. It was already hard for every remote 
worker who had to communicate with clustered workers crammed in loud 
conference rooms, often in blatant violation of fire codes. It’s only 
now more obvious to everyone how difficult it was for the remote workers 
to communicate before. 

## Remote Shell Shock

I was the first fully remote worker at my job back in 2013. It happened 
very suddenly. One month I was happily driving 3 days a week to our 
Orlando office, the next I plan a move back home to France, and set up 
shop as an independent contractor at my old 30 square meters studio in 
Paris. I became the only full-time remote collaborator. Six timezones 
away. Thomas Meeks, my manager at the time, told me: be loud about any 
friction you encounter, we want to make this work and you’re going to be 
the canary in the coal mine. 

## Inadequate Meeting Habits

So I was. I quickly realized that our stand-up meetings where awful 
remotely. A dozen people standing in a circle in a large echoing open 
space, talking in turn about what they’re working on. That doesn’t quite 
work with a distant iMac camera and a single underpowered 
omnidirectional microphone. Folks eventually volunteered to pass a 
laptop around so I could hear them give their update, or at least point 
the camera in the general direction of the speaker. This was 2014. Yes, 
it was absurd. These intelligent people were working on discrete laptops 
all day but somehow crowded around a single one to give each other 
updates. The obvious-in-hindsight realization was that our team standup 
included way too many people. It was easy to dismiss this problem in 
person. Eventually, we reduced the size of standups to people who 
absolutely needed to hear updates from each other, and after what feels 
like far too many years those standups became video calls were each 
person connected on their own machine so they could be heard and seen 
whether they were in-office or remote.  

## Communication Bandwidth Modulation

It’s hard to say that I thrived working 7253 kilometers away from my 
co-workers, but somehow, I managed. I enacted a personal policy that has 
persisted ever since, sometimes I surmise to the annoyance of my more 
microphone or camera shy co-workers: any non-binary (yes or no) answer 
should lead to an audio or video call so that context can be provided 
much faster than through back and forth text-based chat. Any 
demonstration should be done over screensharing or recorded (and edited) 
screencast, not with lazily put together step-by-step instructions. 
That's because there are always missing steps, and you never identify 
them when you’re writing them down. You waste other people's time 
instead.

## Remote Presence Circa 2014

This is where we get to the meat of it all: high fidelity. By definition 
being *remote* means not being *there*. Presence has a way to make some 
things happen. A simple look can trigger a strong reaction and a sense 
of shared understanding. The slightest change in intonation communicates 
doubt or excitement better than a paragraph (or five) ever could. I was 
lucky to have participated in a weekly podcast called Ruby5 at work. I 
learned some of the intricacies of audio engineering and production. As 
an avid amateur photographer, I had a keen sense of how digital sensors 
handle lighting conditions and how those affect the representation of 
the human face. So cameras are nothing without proper direct lighting on 
the subject, and backlighting (light sources pointing at the camera 
itself) must be [avoided at all costs][1]. While in Paris, I purchased a 
Logitech C920 720p (1280 by 720 pixels) webcam. Because I had done some 
research on dynamic microphones (as opposed to the condenser microphones 
we used to record the podcast) I bit the bullet and bought — at my own 
expense — an absurdly expensive [Shure SM7B microphone][2], a Scarlett 
2i2 XLR to USB interface (to convert the analog signal to USB) and a 
cheap pre-amplifier with a very visible input volume level dial to punch 
up the notoriously low default output of the Shure microphone. 

## Sensors Aren't Eyes and Ears 

It was… a mess. I didn’t know how to set up the audio interface. 
Although this was a fairly simple one. I held out on purchasing a good 
set of studio headphones (like the Sony MDR-7506) because I thought 
(wrongly) that I could have a sense for my own voice’s volume. A 
microphone, like a camera, doesn’t have a human’s perspective on what 
*loud* means. It will happily blast your co-worker’s ears off or sound 
like you’re a kilometer away. It’s not until someone from your team 
complains that you’ll notice your voice was near impossible to hear, 
something you never have to worry about when physically present. Until 
you can afford a fancy microphone or an amplifier with a live level 
monitor, I strongly recommend you wear monitor headphones when you talk 
into a microphone. All the pros do it for a reason, they don't trust the 
microphone to portrait their voice as intended. And no, your AirPods 
don’t count as proper monitors because you can only hear other voices 
when you wear them, not your own. Especially in noise cancellation mode. 
You naturally have an awareness of your own voice level in a room full 
of humans. A microphne has no such awareness. 

## Face Time

Now let’s talk about your face. Apple did something quite meaningful 
with FaceTime. They put the onus on precisely what makes you miss your 
family and friends: their face. Not where they happen to be at the time 
you call them, or the broad context of what’s around them in a 
horizontal view, but their vertical portrait. Somehow, Apple still 
manages to produce webcams that are as bad as they were a decade ago. 
Meanwhile, Apple makes some of the best selfie phone cameras in the 
world. 

I started out with a relatively cheap webcam: the Logitech C920. It's a 
workhorse. It was released in 2012 and its resolution is only 720p. Yet 
for nearly a decade this webcam made sense considering how little 
bandwidth you could dedicate to display a face on the Internet. In the 
late 2010s, more webcams manufacturers introduced full HD or 1080p 
resolution, and later 4K (1920 by 2180 pixels). It was and still is a 
fairly unnecessary output for a face on a screen. But just as 
photography cameras were taken over by the megapixel wars so too did the 
webcam industry only focus on raw output size, rather than output 
quality, especially in low light. 

Compared to the camera sensors that are now commpon on mobile phones, 
webcams are terrible. My friend Justin Searls found a way to use his 
iPhone as a webcam. This seems obvious. It’s far more practical than the 
solution I arrived at before the pandemic: using a Sony A6000 mirrorless 
camera with an expensive 35mm lens and an Elgato Cam Link 4K acquisition 
card so I can use a sensor and lens combo no webcam maker can compete 
with. 

This setup is never the one I recommend to fellow remoters, especially 
folks that aren’t deeply familiar with photography of videography. It’s 
cumbersome, complex, and requires constant fidgeting. Keeping the camera 
on, making sure the color temperature is fixed, the aperture wide enough 
to prevent frequent automatic focus hunting, and the battery replaced 
with a dummy powe adapter to prevent runtime issues. 

Two long years into this pandemic, the only company that seems to have 
grasped the importance of a quality sensor and lens combo is Elgato, 
with their Facecam. Logitech has been on top of the webcam business for 
years, and their best offering is the Logitech Brio. A excellent camera 
sensor on a far too wide camera that befits YouTubers with carefully 
crafted backdrops far more than remote workers whose face should be the 
sole focus, not their environment. You *can* force the 4K Logitech Brio 
to crop most of the background it defaults to showing so you can display 
what truly matters — your face — but it takes some futzing with settings 
which should be unnecessary.

To wrap up this piece, which I originally intended to be more 
actionable, allow me to give you a list of gear I recently recommended 
as an alternative to my unwieldy custom setup[^setup] and which requires 
a budget of roughly $600. Yes, that's a *lot* of money. It's roughly 
double the typical "remote stipend" reluctantly relinquished by 
companies to remote workers, while they happily purchase snacks, 
ergonomic office chairs, networking equipment, and so much more. 

This kit is one of the simplest to use and most reliable you'll likely 
deal with. Yes, you can get find cheaper microphones and cameras if you 
sacrifice what I believe are essential features: 

- flicker-free consistent lighting (no headaches or artifacts) 
- narrow field of view camera lenses trained on your face, not the room
- short pickup pattern (cardioid) microphones with live headphone monitoring
- studio monitors headphones to hear yourself and avoid noise feedback loops

| Focus            | Brand         | Model             | Price |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Lighting         | Elgato        | [Key Ligh Air][9] | $180  |
| Face — Option 1  | Elgato        | [Facecam][16]     | $200  | 
| Face — Option 2  | Logitech      | [Brio][15]        | $200  |
| Voice — Option 2 | AudioTechnica | [AT2005USB][14]   | $80   | 
| Voice — Option 1 | RODE          | [NT-USB][13]      | $170  | 
| Ears             | Sony          | [MDR 7506][12]    | $100  |      

This list is by no means exhaustive, and yes it's very different than 
what I've recommended [in the past][1] because the world of remote gear 
is evolving at last. I'd warn you against integrated 
solutions (all-in-one lighting, camera, microphone) but it's possible a 
company like Elgato will come out a solution that does it all pretty 
well in the future. 

The one-stop-shop doesn't exist quite yet, but I can tell you from 
experience that you can already communicate remotely with higher 
fidelity than the majority of office workers through the world did even
before the pandemic. While your three-dimensional presence will never 
be replaceable, it's possible for two-way communication to have an 
unprecendented amount of subtlety.

I'll leave you with this annecdote. I've had a much more *intricate 
setup*[^2] than the one I recommend here since February 2020 since I was
preparing to author a video course for my Pluralsight and wanted to 
offer students the best possible learning experience. In countless 
meetings, many involving leaders far above my paygrade, I can no longer 
count the number of times someone who matters noticed my facial 
expressions and asked me to share my thoughts.

That kind of visibility is clearly not comfortable for everyone, but 
I think it's hard to argue that remoteness means you will become an 
invisible[^1] employee anymore. 


[^1]: That does require turning on your camera, even in meetings where you don't  expect to say anything. I know there's a big debate about this that is far more complex than the issue of visibility. I don't mean to diminish this. None of this post is meant to argue that it's the personal responsibility of everyone to always have high quality cameras turned on when communicating remotely, far from it. I believe it's the responsibility of employers to deploy the same kind of budgets they deploy to offer basic communication capabilities via in-office IT, and the role of folks like me to advocate to these IT professionals and their leaders, as I have at Pluralsight. 

[^2]: I strongly recommend against going this route for 99% of people but here is my setup for the nerdiest among you, I [recorded a demo][11] when I first set it up although some of the setup has changed since and I'll likely update this post with a more succinct video soon: 
    - [Elgato Key Light Air][9]
      - one key light at a 25 degree angle to the right of my face
      - one fill light pointed at the background or left side of my face
    - [Sony A6000 mirrorless camera][8] with: 
      - battery power adapter
      - [Sony 50mm F1.8 OSS Portrait Lens][6]
      - [Elgato Cam Link 4K][7] (set to 1080p 60 fps) 
      - articulated wall-mounted boom arm
      - when reading pre-written slides for screencasts I also use a rudimentary teleprompter called a Padcaster that reflects the screen of my iPhone in front of the lens of the camera allowing me to make eye contact with the viewer
    - [Shure SM7B][10] XLR dynamic microphone with:
      - a [Motu M2][4] XLR to USB interface with live digital level monitoring
      - a [Cloudlifter CL-1][3] inline amplifier for a "clean" 25 dB boost
      - a [RODE PSA1][5] articulated boom arm which allows me to constantly adjust the microphone to the idea position
