summary: Remote work requires high fidelity communication and it's still not easy to achieve.

This pandemic isn’t over. Before it even started, remote work was on the rise around the world. 

Why? Because it makes sense. Knowledge work doesn’t have to be centralized to crammed, loud, distracting, unhealthy open offices located in overly expensive areas. It also makes little sense for knowledge workers who work on laptop to bring that laptop to a room inside of a building they have to travel hours to and from every single day. The road hazard risks alone are absurd. 

Instead, more and more people and their bosses make the choice to work remotely. You’ll note that I don’t use the term “Work From Home”. That’s because it’s infused with the kind of butts-in-seats condescension perfected by corporate leaders. You’re not working, you’re “working from home”. Be grateful. We *let* you do that. Absent is any recognition that work is by nature remote when it happens on the Internet. Large companies have offices that are remote from one another. They rely on asynchronous communication *in some way* in order to coordinate work across cities, states, and countries.  

What’s the first thing these inexperienced remote workers complained about when the pandemic led to a massive and sudden exodus from shared offices spaces all over the world in the spring of 2020? It’s hard to communicate remotely.

No shit. It’s hard to communicate. Period. It was already hard for everyone who had to communicate with clustered remote workers who happened to be crammed inside of loud and unsanitary conference rooms (often in blatant violation of fire codes). It’s just more obvious to everyone how hard it was for remote workers to communicate before. 

I was the first fully remote worker at my employer back in 2013. It happened about as suddenly as the pandemic did. One month I was happily commuting 3 days of the week to our downtown Orlando office, the next I had to move back home to France and set up shop as an independent contractor at my old 30 square meters studio in Paris. In reality it happened over several months, but that didn’t change the fact that I was suddenly thrust into being the only full-time remote collaborator of the company. My manager at the time, Thomas Meeks, gave me one prompt: be loud about any friction you encounter, we want to make this work and you’re going to be the canary in the coal mine. 

So I was. I quickly realized that our stand up meetings where quite difficult to attend remotely. A dozen people standing in a circle in a large open space talking about what they’re currently working on doesn’t quite work with a faraway camera and a single weak microphone on a distant computer. People had to volunteer to pass a laptop around so I could hear them give their update, or at least point the camera in the general direction of the speaker. This was 2014. 

It’s hard to say that I thrived working 7253 kilometers and 6 timezones away from my co-workers, but somehow, I managed. I enacted a person policy that has lasted ever since. Any non-binary (yes or no) answer usually warrants an audio or video call so that context can be provided faster. Any demonstration should be done over screensharing or recorded (and edited) screencast, not lazily put together step-by-step instructions. Because there are always missing steps, and you never identify them when you’re writing them down. 

And this is where we get to the meat of this piece: high fidelity. By definition being *remote* means not being *there*. Presence has a way to make some things happen. A simple look can trigger a strong reaction an shared understanding. The slightest change in intonation communicates doubt or excitement better than a paragraph (or five) ever could. I was lucky to have participated in a weekly podcast called Ruby5 at work. I had learned some of the intricacies of audio engineering and production. As an avid amateur photographer, I had a keen sense of how digital sensors handle lighting conditions and how those affect the representation of the human face. I purchased a Logitech C920 720p (1280 by 720 pixels) webcam, and because I had done some research on dynamic microphones (as opposed to the condenser microphones we used to record the podcast) I bit the bullet and bought an absurdly expensive Shure SM7B microphone, a Scarlett 2i2 XLR to USB interface (to convert the analog signal of the mic) and a cheap pre-amplifier to punch up the notoriously low output of the Shure microphone (which is more designed for loud music than voice). 

It was… a mess. I didn’t know how to set up the interface. Although this was a simplified one. I held out on purchasing a good set of studio headphones (like the Sony MDR-7506) because I thought wrongly that I could have a sense for my own voice’s volume. But a microphone, like a camera, doesn’t have a human’s perspective on loud. It will happily blast your co-worker’s ears off or sound like you’re a kilometer away. It’s not until someone from your team says something that you’ll notice you sound way off. Something you never have to worry about when you’re physically present. So until you can afford a fancy microphone or amplifier with a live level monitor, I strongly recommend you wear monitor headphones when you talk into a microphone. All the pros do it for a reason. No, your AirPods don’t count as monitor headphones because you can only hear others when you wear them, especially in noise cancellation mode, not your own voice. That’s what matters. You naturally have an awareness of your own voice’s level in a room full of human but a microphone isn’t a human. 

Now let’s talk about your face. I think Apple did something quite special with FaceTime. They put the onus on precisely what makes you miss your family and friends: their face. Not where they are, the broad context of what’s around them in a horizontal view, but their vertical portrait. Somehow Apple still produces webcams that are as bad as they were a decade ago, yet they have some of the best selfie-focused cellphone cameras in the world. It says a lot about how out of touch Apple is as a company when it comes to remote work that they understand how to offer tools to remote families but not remote workers. 

At first, like everyone I started with a relatively cheap webcam. The Logitech C920 is a workhorse. It was release sometime in 2009 or 2010. It’s only 720p but for a long time, that made a lot of sense considering how little bandwidth one could dedicate to actually displaying a face across the Internet. Then progressively more and more webcams started to brag about having Full HD or 1080p resolution, then later 4K (1920 by 2180 pixels) which was and still is unnecessary as an output resolution for a face on a screen. However, just like the megapixel war in photo cameras didn’t focus on quality, so too did the webcam competition only focus on raw output size. A size that was rarely used, and frankly rarely looked good since the sensors on webcams are so tiny and cheap, especially compared to those which proliferated on mobile phones at exactly the same time. My friend Justin Searls figured out a way to use his iPhone as a webcam and that makes a lot of sense to me. It’s a lot more practical than the solution I ended up with before the pandemic started: using a Sony A6000 mirrorless camera with an expensive 35mm lens and an Elgato Cam Link 4K acquisition card so I can use a sensor and lens combo no webcam maker can compete with. 

This setup is never the one I recommend to fellow remoters, especially folks that aren’t deeply familiar with photography of videography. It’s cumbersome, complex, and requires constant fidgeting. Keeping the camera on, making sure the color temperature is fixed, the aperture wide enough to prevent frequent automatic focus hunting, and the battery replaced with a dummy powe adapter to prevent runtime issues. 

Two long years into this pandemic, the only company that seems to have grasped the importance of a quality sensor and lens combo is Elgato, with their Facecam. Logitech has been on top of the webcam business for years, and their best offering is the Logitech Brio. A excellent camera sensor on a far too wide camera that befits YouTubers with carefully crafted backdrops far more than remote workers whose face should be the sole focus, not their environment. You *can* force the 4K Logitech Brio to crop most of the background it defaults to showing so you can display what truly matters — your face — but it takes some futzing with settings which should be unnecessary.
