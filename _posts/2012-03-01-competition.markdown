A few years ago I was an avid listener of Penn Jillette's [Penn Radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Radio) show with Michael Goudeau â€“ a vegas juggler and staff writer on _Penn & Teller: Bullshit!_. On several episodes of the show Penn discussed the notion that performers like David Blaine or Criss Angel were competition to Penn & Teller's own show in Vegas, he admitted finding the notion very short-sighted.

Most people freak out when they see a competitor who is portrayed in the media as _fresher_ and more _edgy_. It's a bit of a shock to the system, suddenly you're not the only venue in town anymore. But you've never been the only venue in town.

First, the group of people who pay for a flight to Vegas and a ticket to see Penn & Teller doesn't necessarily overlap with the group of people who like to watch street magic on cable, so the success of one doesn't come at the detriment of the other. Second -- and most importantly -- any mass media attention directed towards magic is beneficial to all magicians, especially established ones. As Penn puts it, if Magic pulls in big ratings on TV, you can bet ticket sales for Penn & Teller will get a nice boost as well. And this pattern has been reproduced, repeatedly.

The market for magic isn't a limited resource.

Now take the online education market. Mature isn't the first adjective that comes to mind, it's in a state of _gold rush_. It's true that several companies have existed in the space for a few years, but recently new interactive experiences have attracted a much broader audience. The incorporation of game mechanics has also allowed those services to sustain the interest of a new audience better than ever before.

So to come back to Penn Jillette's bit of wisdom, guess what happens every time someone asks me if I'm worried about Code School or any other service being eclipsed by Khan Academy or another big media fish?

If there's a white board nearby, I grab a marker, and I draw this:

Excuse the hyperbole, but not unlike the universe, the online education market is growing at a fast rate, and knowing that billions of people are due to discover the web in the next decade that growth is not about to slow down. Now, if you picture [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.com) and [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) as the two larger circles (left and right) in term of mindshare, [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) and [Code School](http://codeschool.com) as the smaller circles (top and bottom), you can get a better idea of what I mean.

Competition might be worrisome in a relatively stable market where each service is targetting similar groups of customers, but this could not be further from reality.

School teachers today have to design their courses around three different learning styles: visual, auditory and kinesthetic.
