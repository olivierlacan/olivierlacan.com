**The following post is reproduced from [Orientation][3] — Code School's 
internal documentation system. I wrote it many years ago when we first 
decided to build out the team that took care of codeschool.com. I was a 
very early member of that team and many things we built were created 
under very different circumstances by a rotating cast of developers who 
rarely stuck around for more than a few weeks or months. This could be 
very disorienting for someone joining to work on the largest codebase 
in the company by far.**

Whenever someone joins our team and I have the chance to talk to them at 
the very beginning, the first thing I make sure to have with them is the 
Immunity Talk.

It shouldn't be this way, but in many companies the first few months 
after you join are generally the ones during which it seems like your 
opinion matters the least. You haven't built relationships with people 
yet. You don't know who's receptive to criticism and comments yet. You 
feel like you have everything to prove and so whenever you encounter 
something odd — something that doesn't quite make sense to you — you 
tend to brush it aside.

A lot of people do this, and it makes me really sad. 

Whenever you're stuck working on something for too long it's common to 
ask for a "fresh pair of eyes". You want someone with a different 
perspective or a different set of assumptions to look at what you've 
been struggling with. It often works amazingly well because after 
working on the same thing for a while, lots of things become part of the 
noise. You don't notice typos. You don't realize that there's a glaring 
mistake or a bad assumption. People with fresh eyes, however, can often 
spot what the problem is instantly. 

![Rubber Duck People][1]

This logic is so obvious to so many people that we've even invented a 
way to simulate it: [Rubber Duck Debugging][2]. That's when you pretend 
to talk to a Rubber Duck on your desk and explain every step of the 
problem you're facing to them. Just like the fresh pair of eyes, it's 
often within the first few steps that you realize you've made a 
fundamental mistake that can easily be corrected. It avoids you the 
embarassment of asking for help and having someone immediately realize 
that you forgot a single semicolon in the most obvious spot.

Somehow though, this logic is never applied to new hires or recent 
additions to a team. We don't realize the value of their fresh eyes on 
this thing we've been working on for so long. In our context at Code 
School, it could be some code that we forgot about and is causing 
obvious performance issues. Or it could be a policy that we've 
established years ago and never really reconsidered, until someone 
asks: "Why do we do this?". And we realize that no one has a clue. 

So instead of thinking of yourself or your new teammates as people with 
not enough knowledge to hold a valuable opinion, I challenge you to 
think of all the things that could be fixed by a few pairs of fresh 
eyes and some well-needed critical thinking.
