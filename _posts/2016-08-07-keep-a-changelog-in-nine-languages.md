After months of on and off work, keepachangelog.com is now officially versioned!

We are, of course, using an [internal changelog][cl] to document minor version
evolutions but so far this wasn't properly reflected on the website.

Now that the latest version (0.3.0) is public, it will be much easier to
coordinate the many translations that have been streaming in steadily over the
past few years. If you know anyone who could help translate

I'm grateful to all the contributors to this project[^1] but
to the following folks for submitting pull requests with translations:

- [Tianshuo][tianshuo] for the Chinese translation(s)
- [Michael Burri][mpbzh] for German
- [Magnus Ã–sterlund][magol] for Swedish
- [Emre Erkan][karalamalar] for Turkish
- [Alexandr Borisov][aishek] for Russian
- [Talles L][tallesl] for Brazilian Portugese
- [Omar del Real][ZeliosAriex] for Spanish

[RailsDiff][rd]) who was my rubber duck while going through the final changes
last Friday so I could finally release this.
