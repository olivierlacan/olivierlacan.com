My digressive brain started to run wild while watching Bret Victor's fascinating talk [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366) a few minutes ago.

## What if we're wrong?

What if Bret is right and the red, green, refactor isn't a feedback loop that promotes creativity and discovery? Sure, it's fast. It's iterative and it gives us a suite of clearly defined assumptions to rely on in order to gauge the stability of the programs we're building.

But what if such a science-based programming — as I like to think of it — is sacrificing an essential component of the process of building?

I recognize that as someone who begun as a designer I have a tendency to regress to that mean. The one of experimentation, trial and error. The one of repeated fumbles and smudges that with perseverance can turn into a great thing. That's how I instinctively want to write my code even though I know that I'm not skilled or controlled enough to be trusted without the safety net provided by testing.

## Another way

Or maybe the kind of programming that Bret presents through his innovative development environment is just one other way to code. A way more suited for creating visual output, animations, interfaces. Maybe that's where the front-end development community will gravitate toward. Come to think of it, it would make a lot of sense.

It's difficult for me to resist the appeal of a human and feedback-friendly interface. I believe the feedback loop is something too many creators neglect. A sanity check where sanity equates to reality and can take developers back down to the ground when they get lost in abstractions.

Having spent a good part of the afternoon toying with [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and its various extensions I realize that this kind of fast and tangible output is something I have been craving for.
