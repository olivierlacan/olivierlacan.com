Although the circumstances are more rushed than I would have hoped, I'm starting
a weekly Ruby news podcast called [Ruby Facets][rf]. The [first episode is
already available][one] and [I'm using Patreon][patreon] to fund the ongoing
production of the show.

If you were a [Ruby5][ruby5] listener in the past, Ruby Facets may sound
familiar to you. There's a reason for that. Ruby5 is no more. After 7 years,
645 episodes, 69 hosts, and lots of fun, Code School — who's been producing and
funding the show for about 3 years — decided it was time to move on.

It's not really a judgement of Ruby5 as a show, Code School simply stopped
producing all the five-minute podcasts based on Ruby5 — [FiveJS][fivejs] and
[iOS Bytes][iosbytes] too. I have very mixed feelings about this
decision but ultimately it's up to us as community members to decide what we'd
like to contribute.

I think I still have something to contribute to the Ruby community in the form
a news podcast. Ruby Facets will not try to be exactly everything that Ruby5
was. For one I don't intend on working with co-hosts for now, simply because
the logistics of producing the show need to be as simple as possible considering
I'm trying to fund the show without sponsors.

If there's one thing I gathered from working with [Gregg][gregg],
[Nate][nate], [Carlos][caike], and many others on Ruby5 is that quality and
curation matter. Ruby5 ran *about* 5 minutes with approximately 5 news stories
which is a pretty dense information to airtime ratio compared to most podcasts.
The show valued the listener's time and had a clear purpose: keeping people
up-to-date with community news.

I learned a lot from the sound quality we thrived for on Ruby5. There are sadly
still plenty of podcasters who don't recognize that if copywriting and proper
grammar are not just a nice-to-have on a blog, then audio quality isn't just a
nice-to-have either on a podcast. Both are a reflection of attention to details
and respect for your audience.

There's another aspect I want to infuse Ruby Facets with as much as possible: a
sense of community. Although it will be difficult to achieve with a single host,
I'm going to try to synthesize the good and exciting things I see happening in
the Ruby community. That will require discipline on my part since the show will
be biased by my own point of view for now. Thankfully there's all of you out
there with your own opinions and ideas and exciting projects that the whole
community should hear about.

If this vision for the show excites you too, [you can become a patron of Ruby
Facets on Patreon][patreon]. Monthly donations range from $1 to $5 and I'm
very interested to hear your thoughts about the show [on Twitter at @rubyfacets]
[twitter]. Instead of hoarding news until the show is released each week I plan
to tweet and retweet links to stories during the week as I gather them.
