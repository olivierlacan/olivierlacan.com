A little more than two years ago I was discovering the wonders of CSS3 with fellow web designers and it seemed some of the user interface polish we could only dream up in Photoshop before was now able to be done without bitmap images in the browser.

I started playing around with border-radius – something that used to take up to 8 individual images to create – and discovered it was a simpler effect to create, preview and adjust than any of the tools Photoshop offered me. And it was undestructive.

That's when it hit me. Adobe's Photoshop team had cooked up layer styles years prior and somehow this tiny piece of CSS3 was more easy to experiment with that was graphical user interface which was until then the de facto standard for user interface design.

Since then the trend has nothing but amplified. I remember having a rocky debate with Gus Hernandez, one of my user interface mentors at Full Sail University regarding my opinion that "designing in the browser" would become prevalent and that Photoshop would soon be relegated to visually rich interfaces only.

Gus didn't budge, I think his main point was that Photoshop allowed a freedom from technical implementation that was crucial in a conceptual design stage where you want to leave as many doors open as possible to find a solution that best answers the problem at hand.

I think he's right. His mistake in my view was assuming that Photoshop was in fact the ideal friction-less environment needed for such an exploration. I've been using Photoshop for 12 years and even at the peak of my usage of the tool (5 to 8 hours a day) I always ran against the limitations of its interface.

For a few years the only solution for CSS-based design experimentation was MacRabbit's CSSEdit (now [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/)) – a wekbit browser that allowed you to load and live-edit an existing stylesheet. More recently, an unlikely replacement has emerged from Google's implementation of the Webkit browser: Chrome's Web Inspector.

Thanks to interface improvements, rapid iteration and a keen ear for developer feedback (now spearheaded by [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish)), Web Inspector has become a place where a simple markup *wireframe* can be toyed with in a surprisingly effortless way.

I can't claim this replaces the visual abstraction and freedom offered by Photoshop's canvas, but it does counter this defficiency by grounding the interface design in the medium which is bound to receive it: the web. And not a portrait-oriented rectangle originally conceived for print design.

So where does that leave Photoshop? If the recent true improvements to the user interface and experience introduced by the [Photoshop CS6 beta](labs.adobe.com/downloads/photoshopcs6.html) prove to not be a short-lived effort by Adobe, Photoshop could slowly catch up on its 3-year lag.

My skepticism isn't a refusal to acknowledge the team's efforts. I welcome them warmly, but they have a lot to make up for.
