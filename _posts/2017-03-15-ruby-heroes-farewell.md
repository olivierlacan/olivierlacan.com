I'm sad to announce that there won't be a [Ruby Heroes][1] ceremony at
RailsConf 2017 and going forward.

The responsibility of organizing the voting, judging, travel accomodations, and
ceremony has rested largely on my shoulders (with much needed assistance from
Ruby Central and Code School) for the past two years after I was handed the
reins of the event. I've also been maintaining the Rails [codebase][2] for many
years now.

I'm at a point in my life where I can't spare the time to dedicate to this
project every year, but I'd be lying if I said this was my sole reason for
pulling the plug.

It's possible that someone in the community will want to keep Ruby Heroes going
on in some form as several copycat events (which have no association to Ruby
Heroes) have been sprouting at diverse Ruby conferences around the world
in recent years. I've considered that myself.

But truthfully, I don't think an award ceremony — however friendly and informal
— is an appropriate solution to try and foster a culture of appreciation in the
Ruby community anymore.

I worry that despite the initial focus of Ruby Heroes having been to shine a
light on underappreciated members of the community, it has invariably become a
place to annoint respected members of the community who — despite being
quite worthy of accolades — don't really need them. I say this knowing full well
that some well-known recipients have been deeply touched by receiving a Ruby
Hero Award in the past.

Then there's the contentious issue of praise and rewards. Even a cursory reading
of Alfie Kohn's seminal book [Punished by Rewards][5] can shake the conviction
that good intentions excuse all unintended side-effects of handing people
awards. To summarize Kohn's argument, it's very likely that rewards motivate
people for the wrong reasons, demotivate those who didn't need awards to be
motivated in the first place, and generally tend to turn something enjoyable
into a chore because only chores must prompt compensation with a reward.

While I believe that Ruby Heroes has benefited some of its recipients personally
and professionally over the years, I can't shake the feeling that it's also had
a much less visible negative impact on their and other people's long term
motivation in the long run. I could be wrong.

Although they have a different focus, initiatives like [Ruby Friends][4] and
[SayThanks.io][4] are giving Rubyists a way to appreciate each other and the
community members they look up to. I welcome all initiatives from the open
source and Ruby communities to spread thankfulness, appreciation, and gratitude.

One of the best perks of the job has been to read the amazingly kind comments
people sent throughout the years about their Ruby Heroes nominees. I don't know
if these kind words are best kept private or public. But I know how something so
simple as a grateful tweet or email can have a similar deep lasting impact on
the recipients.

There are many ways to appreciate the people who inspire you and make your
community better. You can thank them, hug them or you can help them by
supporting the efforts they hold dear. [RubyGems.org][6] recently made it
possible to find reverse dependencies for gems. Think about the human
dependency graph of our community. Who depends on whom and vice versa?

[Libraries.io][7] offers a fantastic tool called "Improve the Bus Factor" which
lists the most highly dependended upon libraries with the fewest maintainers and
contributors. If that's not a call to action, I don't know what is.

PS: Thanks to everyone who has supported the mission of Ruby Heroes throughout
the years in spite of its failings. I've never been more proud of the Ruby
community now that it's out of the brightest limelight, and I can't wait to see
all the amazing people and projects that will make it up in the years to come.
