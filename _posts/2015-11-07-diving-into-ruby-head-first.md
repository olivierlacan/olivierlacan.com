I did technical reviewing for Jay McGavren's new and excellent Head First Ruby book
which comes out November 30th. I can tell you that it's by far the best book
I've ever read for people who are new to programming, new to Ruby, and new to
Object-oriented thinking. That said, I'm neither, and I still found it a great read.

You should [pre-order a copy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449372651/ref=cm_sw_su_dp)
while it's still 43% off ($25.70 instead of $44.99).

After five years, Ruby is still a joy for me to use every single day. It baffles
me that people refrain from using it because their friend's uncle's sister's
brother's mother's friend told them "it doesn't scale". You know what scales
incredibly well with Ruby? The code. Refactoring code, expanding it, breaking it
into parts that communicate with each other like a living organism would. Most of
what you do with software is not scaling, it's changing the code.

It's not just Ruby, the tool, that I cherish. It's the people of Ruby. Its
creators, maintainers, and the people who sustain its community by inviting
more people to it. Often, I see people making technological choices based
solely on the merits of the tools. They forget to care about whether the makers
of the tools are friendly or helpful human beings. But tools are made by
people, and people are flawed. The flaws of their tools reflect their own
flaws. Put differently, if people who dislike other people make tools, then
their tools will tend to disregard people or even treat them poorly, as a
second thought.

I don't think I have to give you examples of people-unfriendly technology. There's
still far too much of it around. I believe Ruby is a beacon in a sea of tools
designed to achieve an end at whatever human cost. It's not the only beacon, but
it's the one I chose, and I'm still very happy with it.

I've managed to scale my professional life with Ruby. We run a
[business](https://www.codeschool.com) with 2 Million users using mostly Ruby
and yet we don't wake up in the middle of the night because Ruby stopped
scaling. We spend far more time stressing out about operations, support,
building course content, designing the best software we can for our users, and
communicating with each other.

I wish the kinds of programming joys I experience daily to everyone who wants to
learn how to build good, sustainable, satisfying software that focuses on helping
human beings learn more and build better tools. I think Head First Ruby is a good
place to start.

PS: Amazon doesn't offer the ebook version of this book. You can
[buy the early release ebook version](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596803995.do)
if you want to start reading today. It will be updated once the book is published.
