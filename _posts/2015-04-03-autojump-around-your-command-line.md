Pairing with someone for the first time is always an exciting time for me. It
used to be anxiety-inducing when I was still convinced that pairing with
someone I considered more experienced was an opportunity for them to discover
that I had no idea what I was doing.

Of course, while some pairing sessions go better than others, that didn't happen.
Or at least people I paired with didn't tell me that they thought I was a fraud.
I didn't get fired right after my early pairing session either. So I found solace
in the fact that had I been *shockingly bad* they might have taken the time to
tell someone else how much I sucked.

I call that dealing with impostor syndrome through rationalizations.

Back to pairing. Even when I was far less experienced than I am now
