Monday morning I made [a website](https://cantheyseemydick.com) on a whim after watching [an impressive interview of Edward Snowden from John Oliver](https://youtu.be/XEVlyP4_11M?t=14m9s).

I took me 27 minutes to create the basic shell of the website, transcribe the relevant portions of the interview, tweak the styles and remove unnecessary things.

A few hours later a security engineer at "Large Tech Company" [made a great suggestion on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/585151317779165184):

> .@olivierlacan can you pls support SSL on this very important website so they can't see if I'm seeing if they can see my hypothetical dick?

The irony of having a website about warrantless privacy intrusion being succeptible to warrantless privacy intrusion was too great not to tackle. I asked for help from a few other people on Twitter who were in agreement since I had never setup SSL/HTTPS
