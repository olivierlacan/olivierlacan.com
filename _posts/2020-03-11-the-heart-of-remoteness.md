summary: It's easy to feel lost working remotely, but it doesn't have to be that way.

I've been working remotely part time since January 2012. After a couple
of years working remotely on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I was suddenly
forced to go full-remote when my work visa expired in late 2013. I had
months to prepare and it was still very hard on my mental health. I
strongly recommend [Alice Goldfuss' piece on this topic][2].

Alice briefly mentions improvements you can make to your video setup. I'd like
to expand on those. I've already written about how to improve your
[audio][3] and [video setup][4] before but I mostly suggested working with
and improving on the gear you already have. That assumes you have gear
to begin with. A lot of employers don't offer remote work stipends
either because they're misinformed about the value of that investment or
because they expect "work from home"[^1] to only happen occasionally.

## Face Time Matters

> Why do I even need to turn on my camera for video meetings anyway? I'm not
even talking most of that time.

I'm not here to solve your useless meeting problems. If there's not a very good
reason for you to be in a meeting that's something you should address first.
What I can tell you with confidence is that not seeing your co-workers' faces
and the emotions they cary -- whether they're actively participating or not --
tends to dehumanize them. A disembodied voice is always jarring. Who *you* are
may be obvious from your perspective but it's far from obvious to everyone else.
Sure, video meeting software like Zoom tends to highlight the current
speaker but something crucial is getting lost: social cues.

When I'm about to speak sometimes I raise my eyebrows. Or I open my mouth
subconsciously because I want to add something or respond to a question that
was posed. More obviously I occasionaly raise my hand with my flat palm facing
out to explicitely signal (without interupting) that I'd like to say something.

You cannot do that if people cannot see you.

## Faces Not Rooms

It's safe to expect that if you have a laptop, then this laptop has a webcam.
If you're lucky enough to have a dedicated monitor at work or at home, it's
relatively affordable ($50 to $70) to equip it with a 720p or 1080p camera that
can stream 30 frames per second (fps) and even trasmit

[^1]: WFH or work from home is not something you'll often hear people
who work remotely full-time say because it's reductive and focuses way
too much on the "home" aspect. Everyone in every company ever eventually
works remotely or in a distributed fashion from one another, whether
it's different floors or different offices.
