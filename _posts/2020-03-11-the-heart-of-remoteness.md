I've been working remotely part time since January 2012. After a couple
of years working remotely on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I was suddenly
forced to go full-remote when my work visa expired in late 2013. I had
months to prepare and it was still very hard on my mental health. I
strongly recommend [Alice Goldfuss' piece on this topic][2].

Alice briefly mentions improvements to be made with you video setup. Let
me expand on that. I've already written about how to improve your
[audio][3] and [video setup][4] before but I mostly suggested working
and improving on the gear you already have. That assumes you have gear
to begin with. A lot of employers don't offer remote work stipends
either because they're deluded about the value of that investment or
because they expect "work from home"[^1] to only happen occasionally.

[^1]: WFH or work from home is not something you'll often hear people
who work remotely full-time say because it's reductive and focuses way
too much on the "home" aspect. Everyone in every company ever eventually
works remotely or in a distributed fashion from one another, whether
it's different floors or different offices.
