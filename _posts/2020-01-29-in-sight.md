![Close up of Razer Kiyo and Logitech C920 webcams on top of a computer monitor][2]

In the last decade, while phone cameras have gone from shooting tiny
noisy pictures to producing DSLR-level quality shots, webcams have
coasted on the mediocre lane. As distributed or remote work became more
common, we've never relied on webcams more yet they're just as bad as
they were ten years ago. The Logitech C920 (~$50), still The Wirecutter’s top
pick in 2020, came out in January 2012 — the year of the chamfered-edged
iPhone 5.

I can’t fix lazy hardware design for webcam manufacturers although I do
have a long wish list (larger lenses, better sensors, lighting rings,
etc.) but I can give you some tips to help your remote co-workers
interface with the most important tool next ot your finger tips: your
beautifully expressive face.

## Point the light toward *you*

I can’t count the number of meetings I’ve participated in where the main
speaker -- often someone important -- chooses to sit with their back to a
window (or several). It's a recipe for webcam disaster, and easily the most
common mistake.

Webcams calculate the average light ouput within a frame to determine how
to balance the exposure value. When you sit in front of a bright
daylight window, you’re turning yourself into a minority exposure sample
because the majority of the frame is much brighter than you. Innevitably,
your background washes you out and your face is shrouded in darkness.

Next time this happens to you, try to use your hands to prevent as much
light from reaching the webcam lens as possible. Immediately, you'll see
your face brighten on the webcam feed. Since this isn't really a
practical thing to do while having a conversation, please try never to
point your webcam toward a window while on a call. Your coworkers will
thank you.

Since the Kiyo ships with an adjustable ring light, it can easily compensate for bright backgrounds." %}

Some days, or inside of dark offices, pointing a window *at* your face
might not be an option. Try to find a bright desk lamp with a lampshade
that can diffuse light so it’s not too harsh on your face. I use a
simple double-bulb lamp with two 5.5 Watt LED soft white bulbs (2700
Kelvin) as a backup light source. If you can afford a higher webcam
budget, the newer Razer Kiyo webcam (~$80) has an adjustable LED light ring
around it which provides incredible lighting. I wish more webcams
offered this option. The improvement is staggering.

## If you can’t zoom in, get closer

Your face matters. I know you might not *love* your face (therapy is
priceless) but if you’re going to represent less than 50% of the total
size of the webcam frame, you might as well turn your video off and rely
on your voice alone, or just type an email with what you mean to say and
send it to your team.

Faces are incredibly detailed interfaces. If I can see your face on a
video call, smile, and tell you to go to hell in response to a joke,
it's likely you'd understand that I'm not actually offended nor that I
mean to actually insult you. When that situation unfolds with little or
no visual context, it can be a lot more tricky to determine if the
conversation is in good fun or not. One of the most difficult aspects of
remote work is the lack of high bandwidth communication. Unsurpsingly,
and despite the many advantages of distributed work, face-to-face
conversation tend to prevent ambiguity. But the comparison is often
unfair because little to no effort is made to increase the
conversational bandwidth of remote discussions.

can be changed."
caption="Webcam Settings (macOS) can alter the digital zoom level of most
external webcams, allowing you to focus on your face but also avoid drawing
attention to your messy work area." %}

I use a macOS Menu Bar app called [Webcam Settings][1] to tweak my
external webcam's default setting. It’s not free ($7.99) but worth the
cost and compatible with most third-party webcams. It allows you to dig
into settings that your operating system or the webcam don’t expose:
white balance, brightness, saturation, zoom level and exposure time.

You might be able to find alternative tools for your own OS. If you
can’t, perhaps try to find a way to bring your webcam closer to you.
Screen-mounted webcams can only get so close, which is why zooming is
such a good option in my mind.

to notice how distracted he is in this meeting."
caption="Most webcams default to wide angles which make no sense in many group
calls where your webcam video will only be displayed as a tiny thumbnail, so
zoom in if you can, or get closer." %}

Sadly Webcam Settings doesn't work with Apple's embedded FaceTime
webcams on most of the models I've tried it on. Thankfully webcams like
the Riyo and the C920 are easy to carry while traveling with a laptop
(although you'll need a USB-C to USB-A hub). By the way, if you can
avoid the chin-o-vision distorsion effect that occurs when a laptop is
pointed up toward your face. Laptops webcams are rarely very flattering to
begin with, and this kind of angle also tends to accentuate lighting issues
because ceilings are often brighter than most skintones which once again will
make you look too dark.

## No peeking

It's unlikely someone's spying on your via your webcam unless you've angered
a nation-state or you have exceptionally bad [operational security][5] but it
doesn't hurt to cover your bases.

Webcam cover are fine, especially if you get them for free (some new
C920 models ship with one). But if you don't want to bother puting the
cap on and off a webcam cover, I'd recommend at least making sure you're
notified when your webcam is active or not. Patrick Wardle from
Objective-See makes a little utility called [OverSight][6] which does
exactly that. It can also let you know when your microphonne is
activated.

## Don't talk to webcams

Embedded microphones on webcams are just bad. The reasons are simple:
- manufacturers have little incentive to improve them.
- webcams are too far from your mouth to pick up sound properly.
- embedded microphones are tiny, cheap, and usually terrible.
- the [Larsen effect][3] (proximity to speakers) can cause feedback loops.

I wrote a [whole post about microphones][4] but if you want a one liner:
just use a standalone microphone with or without headphones attached to
it. You'll avoid nasty feedback loops. But if you (or your employer)
can afford it, how your words are transmitted is just as important
as the face that gives those words context, emotions, and a human touch.
