For the last five years of my life I have been a non-immigrant, living the United States of America.

## How did I end up there?
I was extremely lucky to be raised by parents who were addicted to traveling. We went to Sicily and Greece when I was a little kid, to Ireland, Belgium, and Spain when I was young, and our longest adventures took us to Canada for many years in the summer.

It was pretty obvious then but it is all the more now that this was a privilege few other kids had. I got to see the world — not just the continent nearby — before I was even 11 years old. That had a huge impact on how I saw and thought about the world. And I'm pretty sure that it was a major factor in my early fascination with the Internet.

When my parents and I went to Canada, mostly to Québec (it's easier after all for French speakers and the place is beautiful), I think we all thought of it as a more civilized version of the United States. No crazy gun-totting Americans, no scary violence and more forests and lakes. The USA seemed like a scary place and my parents didn't really want to visit it, except maybe places like New York City. But we aren't really the city tourist kind.

Probably through much pressure on my part, my parents finally had cable TV and Internet installed in 2001. We had used dial-up previously since. The arrival or broadband internet — along with my dad's contagious knack for tinkering with computers — is one of those things I can easily point to as a crucial moment in my life.

Suddenly, downloading MP3s didn't risk getting me in trouble anymore. I could even attempt video downloads instead of hoping a RealVideo or QuickTime stream would finally stop buffering.

I was flicking through channels in Canada when I found a show on FOX that reminded me quite a bit of The X-Files. For good reason, I would later find out, because the episode's director was David Nutter — a reknown TV show pilot director who set the tone for The X-Files. The show was called Dark Angel and had been created by James Cameron while he was probably waiting for CG technology to be good enough to grace the world with giant blue people. Aside from the post-apocalyptic science fiction bent, the show had a very "interesting" lead actress for a teenager like myself: Jessica Alba.

All these factors merged with the fact that the show wasn't going to premiere back in France for probably a year made me quite addicted to the program. Over the following summer, as my second website ever — the first was an earnest but embarassing shrine to Real-time Strategy games like Age of Empire and Sim City — I decided to build JamPonyXpress
