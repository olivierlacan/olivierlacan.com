While 2022 was all about [joins][1], this year we made a whole new 
record.

Her name is Zoé and she's wonderful. I can't wait for her to meet the 
world in spite of its flaws.

Along the way, Zoé helped me refocus on what really matters: 

- getting lost in that afternoon shine
- holding hands (or fingers)
- ~naps~
- the percussive pleasure of deep farts 💨
- improvising harmonies to soothing songs
- watching sunrises *and* sunsets like the movie premieres they truly are
- walking and singing (at the same time)
- feelings within &amp; without
- blissful abandon

Merci Zouzou et à demain matin ☺️
