I know at least one person in your life has told this:

> You can't judge a book by its cover

I'd like to talk about how thoughtless this sentence is. I'm going to
make a fantastic assumption (assumptions are another hairy topic I'll
save for later): you and I agree that design makes things better.

If we do agree on that, here's what a book's cover tells me about what's inside. It tells me that someone involved in the creation of the book cared about its virgin perception. The perception that someone with no prior knowledge of the book, its author, its publisher, its subject — anything — would have about the book.

As someone involved in the creation of a book, caring about a the cover takes humility and empathy. Despite their involvement bias, whoever does care about the cover realizes that there may be humans on earth who do not know why *this* book matters. Why they should read it.

There are some essential elements to a cover. Just imagine for a second an utterly blank cover: a pure white piece of thick paper. What does it tell you about the book? It tells you that someone, perhaps the author, believes that it's unnecessary for the book to have any external means of identification. This is an extreme example. I know. It's always easier to reveal the cracks in an argument when you push its to its logical limit.

Now let's take a beautiful cover. It has everything. The title and the author's name are carefully printed with an elegant typeface and located unambiguously on the front and the spine. There's an interesting illustration that  can attract attention in a bookstore regardless of the prospective reader's artistic taste. If the title doesn't make the subject of the book self-evident, perhaps there's a short subtitle which will secure the interest of someone whose attention was captured from afar. If there are pull-quotes in the back, they're not ridiculously superlative but they do ignite even more curiosity by perhaps originating from people who the passerby may respect and trust.

Let's stop here. Wouldn't you judge this cover significantly differently that you would the blank one? Aside from the fact that a blank cover would admittedly make a book stand out, the odds of you not even being able to judge the blank cover because you won't see it are great.

It doesn't take bad design to make good design stand out. It helps, of course. In a sea of blue icons, a red one stands out. It's a statement. You will judge that statement. It will give you information, however tenuous, about the application behind the icon.

Recently I was looking for an accountant. Sharp turn, I know. Despite being the son of an accountant, I know next to nothing about the topic. All I knew from professional experience were a few keywords that may help me in my search. CPA was one of them: Certified Public Accountant. It seemed like the term to look for. After unsuccessfully asking a few friends for a recommendation, my patience ran short and I decided to take two approaches: Google and Yelp.

I assumed that Google would be littered with paid ads and SEO-gamed results (it was) which would limit my ability to discern good choices from bad ones considering I basically had no criteria to compare a good from a bad CPA. Moreover I didn't expect an accountant's website to help me judge whether they were good at what they do. Unlike web designers, their job isn't to maintain an attractive website.

My one hope laid in the book's cover. Devoid of an ability to judge the substance of something, appearances turn into a powerful signal. So I loaded up a dozen of CPA websites. I filtered the ones with the highest ratings on Yelp and the ones that appeared to be from my local area in Google. I wanted to meet this person. I needed to be able to trust them.

Immediately I saw a barage of stock photography. Some woefully inadequate to the subject matter. I spotted some obvious and unimaginative WordPress themes which were poorly adapted to the task of conveying trustworthiness and experience.

Then something strange happened. I found a beautiful website. Clear navigation focused on what I wanted to know: who this person is, what they do, why it matters, and why they should be trusted.

But even more importantly. There was a sense of taste pervading from the site. You could question the choice of style, but it was unquestionably applied by someone who knew what they were doing. It didn't matter to me whether this CPA built the site themselves or paid someone to do it. All that mattered was that they cared. That told me a lot. The tone of the website's copy was concise, it was fresh. It made me want to trust them because it wasn't boilerplate and it wasn't stuffy.

Now it's possible that this website may have had a different effect on someone older than me or someone from a less web-savvy background who doesn't respond to these cues because they have no special appreciation for good typography, good copy, good content design. Yes, a different effect. But I believe an effect nonetheless. Even ill-equipped to measure professionalism, people can smell it. They can feel it. I did.

And guess what? Afte leaving a message using the contact form conveniently accessible on the home page of the site, I received a phone call from the CPA herself. She matched her cover perfectly. She was warm, professional, sharp and before calling me she even did her homework by looking me up based on the email address I purposefully used on the contact form. She knocked it out of the park.

This *superficial* impression was later confirmed when I met her and the rest of her team. I judged a book by its cover, and it was a damn good book. This is not the first time it has worked out well for me: books, music, restaurants, programming language communities, and even people.

It's true that I've discovered bad books with great covers, but unless I'm letting confirmation bias get the best of me, I had more lucky strikes than bad apples.
