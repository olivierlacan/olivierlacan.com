summary: Decent photography's easier now, but great photography is too.

One of my earliest memories is asking my mom to borrow her Minolta camera to take photos of flowers in her garden. Back then you shot a few dozen photos, went to the store to get the roll developed, got a little envelope with the sliced negative and (matte for us) prints. Once you got home, you'd check them out, pick the few that weren't blurry, poorly framed, overexposed, or (frequently) unflattering. Then you'd either discard the really bad ones, or put them back in the envelope, while the few lucky shots graduated into a bona fide photo album — or better yet, a frame on the wall for the real good stuff.

The ratio of photos shot to photos shown to others was something like 3 to 1 maybe, but then again you'd typically shoot 24 or 36 per roll. So that's maybe 12 good shots. And virtually no one would take more than a single shot of any given moment. When you have only 24 shots in the camera, every single one matters.

Flash-forward to today, my Sony A7C's postage stamp sized SDXC (UHS-II V60 CL10 U3) memory card can hold 2,500 pictures at a resolution of 6000 by 4000 pixels in a RAW file format that affords me the ability to adjust their exposure by multiple f-stops *after* I've taken them. And that's one of a flurry of other modern digital post-processing options at my disposal which were once done manually by photo print studio technicians, but far more frequently automated with automated printing systems. Those were... not great. 

But hey, at least you got your photos back ready to be viewed and shared with friends and family.

While there was an intermediary period where people still mostly printed out digital photos on paper, it took us many years to get to a point where a majority of photos taken on digital cameras never become go back to analog: photo paper. That's changed a lot about people's expectations of the finished product. What looks good when auto-adjusted by a photo print shop probably won't look as good on a screen, especially when there's a million different screen sizes, shapes, and quality. 

So we all kind of gave up for a while, and just slapped on heavy filters on the majority of the photos that we shared, or we let Google and Apple do the auto-adjusting instead of an underpaid photo lab tech. In most cases, that's yielded some decent results. But if you cared about photography as a medium for even humble artistic expression, for a long time there was a huge gap between the professional tools like Photoshop and what was available and affordable to most people. 

Weirdly, the Instagram team changed that. While the app was mostly known for its filters, the team behind it was composed for photography buffs for a long time. They not only brought editing tools to the masses, but they made them actually fun to use. I still remember a weird period between 2013 and 2016 where despite having years of Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom experience, paid photo editing apps like Darkroom on my iPhone, I still shared the majority of my post-processed photos after editing them with Instagram's tools. 

My workflow looked like: 
- take 3 or 5 shots of any given moment I wanted to capture   
- open the Instagram app
- slap some of my favorite filters to see how one of the shots behaved when brightened or darked
- turn off or manually adjust the filter if it was too much
- go into the "advanced" setting to:
	- crop or align the photo if necessary
	- punch up the sharpness (a bit, since Apple already sharpens quite a bit by default)
	- play with the white balance to make a shot slightly warmer or cooler because auto-balance is frequently foiled on cameras
	- add a very light amount of vignetting if the edges drew too much attention from the subject
	- then I'd move on to adjusting shadows and highlights, to see if there was any detail in either that would improve the picture
	- finally I'd play with contrast settings to counter-intuitively bring the amount of detail at the extremes (white, black) back down

Sometimes this process would be even more involved. I recognize this is way too much effort for most people. But photography *and* photo editing are a soothing outlet for my creativity. This rarely ever feels like a job. But it doesn't mean it doesn't get old.

For one, the output of Instagram editing, regardless of the source, used to be extremely small. Roughly 512 by 512, while phone and dedicated cameras kept creeping up in resolution. Even today the highest resolution hosted by Instagram on its website is roughly 1440 pixels. It makes sense, because that's about as big as it'll need to be for even the largest screens. But that's for today's screens, so those painstaking edits will be entirely wasted. That's not too bad if you used an iPhone 15's 24 megapixel native photo resolution, but with more and more cameras are reaching the 48 megapixel range. 

For this reason and others, several years ago I made the switch to Adobe's new cloud-based Lightroom offering. It's a subscription, which tends to anger folks. But those same folks also tend to complain about ads, private information brokers, and shoddy software. At some point, you have to be willing to put money into the things you value, or you don't really get to complain about the status quo. 

## Seeing the Lightroom 

Immediately, let's talk about what hurts: storage-based pricing models. Adobe, like Apple and too many companies who offer high-quality subscription-based software seems to think the cost of their product should increase linearly with the quantity of *stored* media from their users. This is absurd. Digital storage has never been and will never cease to be cheaper than ever before. It would be a lot more reasonable for these companies to offer compute-based pricing models that scale with usage instead. The more photos you *edit* in their system, the more costly resources you're obviously charged for. 

Anyway, let's talk about what made me pick Lightroom, née Lightroom CC, not to be confused with its much older sibling Lightroom Classic.
