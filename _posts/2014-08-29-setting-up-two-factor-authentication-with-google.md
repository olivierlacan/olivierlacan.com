I deal with a lot of security-related issues at Code School. Over the years,
we've seen that password-protected accounts can easily be compromised through:

- irresponsible "security questions" from service providers that are exploitable through basic [social engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29) techniques
- insecure password reset processes that send new passwords in plain text to whichever email happens to be on file, regardless of whether that email was recently updated or not
- unverified email addresses associated with user accounts
-
