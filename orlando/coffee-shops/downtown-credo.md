An honor-system community coffee shop and event space where you can meet
tons of creative people, enjoy good coffee, tea and pastries and great
music.

The staff is incredibly friendly and can brew, steep, or conjure up
some good coffee, tea or hot chocolate for you.

The back of the shop can be rented out for events during the day and the
whole shop can be rented out after 6PM every day.
