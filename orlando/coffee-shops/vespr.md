Hands down the best coffee shop in Orlando. The mood alone warrants a
visit: great quiet music, dim lighting, comfortable wooden chairs and
tables and a beautiful sense of clean design. The menu is a work of art and
hard work that can satisfy coffee and tea lovers.

If you're serious about coffee they have a great single-origin
selection; it can be brewed in multiple ways and they can always
recommend something that matches your taste (pour over, siphon,
etc.). There's plenty of great local snacks and cookies to go with
your drink and their small bites are good for a light lunch.

Make sure to try one of the single origin coffees. If you're an
iced coffee fan, give the cold brews a try. If you like sweet
things in your coffee I can't recommend the Dick Tracy, the
Butterscotch Latte, or the Scarlett Johansson. Tea lovers should
give the selection a sniff but try the Barrel Smoked Sweet Iced
Team â€” this thing is the best mid-afternoon pickup ever if you
prefer to go easy on the caffeine.

In general, just explore the menu. The team puts a lot of work into it
and it shows.
