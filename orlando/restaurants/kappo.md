The Kappo team is bringing exquisite sushi culture to Orlando. If
you manage to snag a seat for lunch (don't plan it, just fucking
go, it's East End Market, you can't fail) please trust me to trust
them and have their Omakase menu. Yes, it's insane to pay this
much for lunch, no you shouldn't care if you've made it this far
into this guide. It's not like you're going to eat this every day.
Their attention to every detail is fascinating, from the very
first bite to the dessert. They'll explain to you everything you
need to know about what you're putting in your mouth and you'll
leave on a little cloud. This is as close as you can get to
Kaiseki (minus the pomp) in Orlando.
