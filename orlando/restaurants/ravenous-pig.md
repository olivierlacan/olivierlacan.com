The Ravenous Pig is quite simply the best restaurant in Orlando. I think I
discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropub">gastropub</a> concept
through it. The idea is simple: great drinks and great food in the same place.

As a Frenchman it was really nice to discover a place in Orlando where
you could clearly feel the French influences.
That means great charcuterie (cold cuts) and cheese platters in to start the meal,
but also their own twist on pub fare like avocado rock shrimp tacos, and the
best salad I've ever had in the word: the Farmer (bitter greens, soft bacon chunks,
parmesan flakes, brioche croutons, vinaigrette and a perfectly soft boiled egg sliced
on top, *swoon*).

Their drinks are serious business too. You should definitely try their house
old-fashioned (bacon-infused buffalo trace bourbon) and other cocktails. I'm
not a beer specialist but they carry great brews, and I can attest that their
wine list is solid as well.

But about the serious eats? They're amazing. Between the Pork Porterhouse,
the marinated flat-iron steak frites, there's a regularly changing cast of
delicious plates prepared with clear attention to detail when it comes to
sourcing, preparation, and presentation. It's far from cheap, the flat-iron
steak frites is $25 at lunch or dinner and the farmer salad is $12 but it's
worth taking a bite out of your budget.
