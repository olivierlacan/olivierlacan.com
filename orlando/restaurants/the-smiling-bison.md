They always have good beer, often good music, and always some
delicious hearty (but not only) food, even late.

My favorites include the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho, and their Duck Lovers
pizza. The Smiling Bison Burger is good, but not as great as it should
be to bear their name considering how neat the place is.

Watch out though, they often get packed and the place isn't that big.
Parking can be tricky too.
