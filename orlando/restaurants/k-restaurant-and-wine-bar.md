Although K's menu is a bit too static, what they serve is often downright
excellent. The eggplant parmesan is great even if you're not a vegetarian
because it will make you understand how one can possibly survive without meat â€”
even though it must be torturous.

On the dinner side, I really like their Duck Breast and Ricotta Gnochi although
I don't believe in "pea-style carbonara". They could almost convince me that it
deserves to be considered.

Their cheese board is from La Femme du Fromage (whose name is actually Tonda and
who you should seek out at East End Market) so that's something you should try.
And please, if you're going to red drink wine, pair it with cheese and red meat,
otherwise you've never tasted wine.
