It's shameful how long it took me to finally try Prato and I wasn't
disappointed. They make and serve the best pasta I've had in a long time. Their
egg bucatini is a goddamn dream and so is the mustard spaghettini ("Cacio E
Pepe", pictured), and I hope you'll find it on their ever changing menu of
glutten wonder.

The wood-fired oven pizza made on the premises is not the best Neapolitan-style
you'll find anywhere but as far as I know it's the best and only in town. Go
with the Margherita or Widowmaker (caciocavallo, romesco, fennel sausage, farm
egg), especially if you come by for lunch.

Their bar alright but I'd focus on wines. Better to take your cocktail drinking
to Cask & Larder nearby or drive over to Hanson's Shoe Repair on Pine Street.
