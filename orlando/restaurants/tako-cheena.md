Affordable, creative, and mostly healthy food: the dishes are a fusion of asian
and latin food. Remember to ask for specials. They change often and it's better
for you to try something new or ask the waiters for advice than stick to your
guns. I made that mistake early on and I regret it.

It's open until midnight from Tuesday to Sunday (which is still far too rare in
the city) and until 4AM on Friday and Saturday, but don't go there wasted with
numb tastebuds please, that would be a waste. I don't like tofu and their crispy
tofu is one of the best I've ever had, so you can bring your vegetarian/veggan
friends along.
