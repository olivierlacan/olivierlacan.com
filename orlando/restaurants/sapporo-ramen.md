You'll have to drive a bit to the Chinese market past Pine Hills (yes, Pine
Hills, deal with it) on 50 but if you need a Ramen fix Sapporo will help. Their
Tonkotsu broth is much too mild for my taste now that I've tried more serious
stuff but they make a very decent Shoyu (soy-based), Shio (salt-based) and Miso
ramen. Their Curry Udon is also particularly great during the few cold weeks in
Orlando.
