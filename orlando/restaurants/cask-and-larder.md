While The Ravenous Pig decidedly has an American-European bent to it, Cask is a
place closer to what one might expect to find in the Southern US. It's a sister
restaurant to the Pig.

I think the best introduction to the restaurant is the Sunday brunch because you
get to test an array of creatively delicious bakery and pastry items and at the
same time you can sample some of their serious dinner food in brunch-friendly
format: coffee-rubbed steak, pig muffin, chicken & waffle, ribeye hot dog,
double stack pork burger.

To compete Ravenous Pig's perfect Farmer salad, Cask's Kale salad is a serious
contender. It's massive (although you can order a half-portion) with delicious
avocado, granola, apples, and bacon vinaigrette.

Cask & Larder has their own brewmaster(s) and the brewery is right inside
the restaurant (you can even eat inside of it if your party's too big for the
other tables or if you sign up for the dream-like Whole Cookery Dinner). Most of
the beers served are house brews and you can even try a flight of them. Bar-side
things are just as serious as the big sister with a very competent staff serving
my favorite cocktails in town (well, ok, Hanson's is in a league of its own)
including the simply perfect Back To Mezcali (sombra mezcal, aperol, house
grapefruit shrub, celery bitters, lemon). Yeah, you want to come thirsty here
too.

Finally let's talk about desserts. Too many menu bottoms are filled with boring
triple-decker chocolate cakes with no flavor, the necessary cheesecake and an
uninspired peanut butter combo. Although Cask' dessert menu varies weekly or
monthly like the rest, there's often an impressive display of daring and varied
stuff. Some of my all-time favorite include a three-chocolate mousse "bomb" cake
with a solid dome-shaped crust, and the delicious chocolate-strawberry cake
pictured above.
