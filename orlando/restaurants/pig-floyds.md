Pig Floyd's (just for that pun you should go) is a recent addition to the
already stellar Mills lineup. You can think of it as a perfect mix between
4River's BBQ and Tako Cheena. It's a lot roomier than most places on Mills (and
it even has a decent parking lot) and the terrace is absolute perfection during
the day. Make sure to try their plantain and Apple Fennel Coleslaw sides. My
favorite tacos are the Al Pastor and Butter Chicken (pictured with the sweet
plantains).
