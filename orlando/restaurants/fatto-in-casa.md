One of the many wonders of the East End Market — a recent arrival on the
Orlando food scene and one of my favorite places in the world — Fatto in
Casa is led by Elisa, a native of Torino, Italy, who brings fresh recipes
every day to this catering joint which makes for a perfect lunch spot when
paired with the lovely half-shaded courtyard outside.
