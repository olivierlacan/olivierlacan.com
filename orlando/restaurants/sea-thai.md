There's a healthy array of Thai restaurants in Orlando but in a few years
in town, none has impressed me as much as SEA (South East Asian) Thai. The
plate presentation, the taste and the quality of service are all top notch.

Sure, it's in a strip mall on the side of Colonial Drive (SR50) and the
outside is plastered with reviews and awards in the least classy way possible,
but once you get inside you discover a subtly decorated and dimly lit little
restaurant with a few booths and tables.

I like their Tom Kha (coconut milk) soup although it's not groundbreaking.
The Phad Thai is delicious, so is the Red Curry, and I can't resist
the Panang Duck, and the Pineapple Duck Curry. Yes, it's clich√© but
if there's any space left try their Thai Donuts, they're great.
