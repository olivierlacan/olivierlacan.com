Kadence used to run a sushi bar at East End market. It is not an affordable
restaurant but it is by far the best sushi experience you're likely to have in
the state of Florida. Yes, it's that good.

It's not like you're going to eat this every day. Their attention to
every detail is fascinating, from the very first bite to the exquisite desserts
created by Jen (Koala Mama).

Kadence feels like an intimate experience  explain to you everything you need to know about what you're
putting in your mouth and you'll leave on a little cloud. This is as
close as you can get to Kaiseki (minus the pomp) in Orlando.
