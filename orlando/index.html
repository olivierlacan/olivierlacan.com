    <p>
      An honor-system community coffee shop and event space where you can meet
      tons of creative people, enjoy good coffee, tea and pastries and great
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff is incredibly friendly and can brew, steep, or conjure up
      some good coffee, tea or hot chocolate for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back of the shop can be rented out for events during the day and the
      whole shop can be rented out after 6PM every day.

    <p>
      Hands down the best coffee shop in Orlando. The mood alone warrants a
      visit: great quiet music, dim lighting, comfortable wooden chairs and
      tables and a beautiful sense of clean design. The menu is a work of art and
      hard work that can satisfy coffee and tea lovers.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the coffee is single origin; it can be brewed pour over style, or
      using the lighter siphon method. There's plenty of great local snacks
      and cookies to go with your drink and the small sandwhiches are perfect for
      a light lunch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make sure to try one of the single origin coffees. If you're an iced
      coffee fan, give the cold brew a try. If you like sweet things in your
      coffee I can't recommend the Dick Tracy (bacon &amp; melted sugar spoonful
      served with a shot of espresso with black truffle chocolate, mapple syrup
      and a jar of hot milk to mix it with), or the Butterscotch Latte (served
      with some whipped cream in a mason jar). Tea lovers should give the selection
      a sniff but try the Barrel Smoked Sweet Iced Team served in a closed mason
      jar full of big ice cubes and smoke (yes, smoke) with a jar of sweet tea
      and a cup of mapple syrup to dump in the mason jar — this thing is the best
      mid-afternoon pickup ever if you prefer to go easy on the caffeine.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, just explore the menu. The owner puts a lot of work into it
      and it shows.

      According to my more knowledgeable coffee-afficionado friends, this is
      hands down the best roaster in the area. They're currently located at the
      back of East End Market which deserves its own section.

<h3>Bakery &amp; Pastry Shops</h3>

  <dd>
    <p>
      There are no better French pastries in Orlando. Accept no imitators.
      Bear in mind, however, that great pastry chefs are not necessarily great
      bakers. The Quiche Lorraine and Croque Madame are also great.
    </p>

    <p>
      My personal recommendation would be the lemon and apple Normandy tarts.
      All the other wet pastries are safe bets even if the dry pastries (croissant,
      pain au chocolat, etc.) are not the best.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.benjaminfrenchbakery.com/">Benjamin's</a></dt>
  <img src="/images/orlando/benjamin-01.jpg" alt="A delicious baguette sandwich at Benjamin's">
  <dd>
    <p>
      One of the things I missed the most from France (and Paris) was the
      "Sandwich Parisien". A really basic ham and cheese sandwich on a fresh
      half-baguette. Thanks to Benjamin's I can ease that craving whenever I want
      now. They make the absolute best baguette in town and it's not a close call.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also have great quiches. While you can try any of them you should
      start with the classic Quiche Lorraine (with bacon bits). The French family
      that runs the show is from Bordeaux, and as you should expect they make
      delicious local specialties called Canelé which you should try.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're coming for lunch, just look over at the "Rustic Sandwiches" list
      and pick a combination that you like, but I beg you, tell them not to toast
      your sandwich. If it was up to me, I wouldn't
      allow people to toast anything else than the inside of a baguette, and only
      very lightly.

  <img src="/images/orlando/old-hearth-01.jpg" alt="The huge and varied wall of bread at Old Hearth">
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is something I've only discovered recently since they now have a home
      base at the East End Market in Audubon Park. Their French Baguette is miles
      better than what Publix passes as a baguette but I would rather recommend their
      excellent "pains". In France, "pains" are larger round loafs of bread that
      generally don't use white dough. Pain au Levain (Sourdough) is one of their
      best. I also recommend their lovely Ciabatta rolls. Don't be afraid to explore,
      I can't think of another local bakery with such a wide selection.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Although Audubon Park was already an interesting neighborhood, P is for Pie
      is the cherry on top. They sell lovely little pies and althouhg it's not a
      marquee offering, great coffee — Portland's Stumptown. I was happy to
      discover they served Stumptown's Cold Brew bottles which paired quite well
      with their delicious Strawberry basil pie.

  <dd>
    <p>
      One of the many wonders of the East End Market — a recent arrival on the
      Orlando food scene and one of my favorite places in the world — Fatto in
      Casa is led by Elisa, a native of Torino, Italy, who brings fresh recipes
      every day to this catering joint which makes for a perfect lunch spot when
      paired with the lovely half-shaded courtyard outside.

    <p>
      Affordable,creative, and mostly healthy food: the dishes are a fusion
      of asian and latin food. If that doesn't
      sound appealing to you, just picture this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Thai Peanut Chicken Tako</li>
      <li>BBQ Pork Belly Tako</li>
      <li>Lamb Tako</li>
      <li>Cod Tako</li>
      <li>Indian Butter Chicken Burrito</li>
      <li>Thai Panang Chicken Burrito</li>
      <li>Spicy Beef and Plantain Banana Empenada</li>
      <li>Apple Ginger Empenada</li>
      <li>Tom Yum Chicken Arepa</li>
      <li>Pernil Pork Fun Bunz</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Remember to ask (or look) for specials. They change often and it's better for you to try
      something new or ask the waiters for advice than stick to your guns. I made
      that mistake early on and I regret it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's open until midnight from Tuesday to Sunday (which is still far too rare in
      the city) and until 4AM on Friday and Saturday, but don't go there
      wasted with numb tastebuds please, that would be a waste.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're vegetarian or vegan, they always have friendly solutions that
      are actually good, not just piss poor consolation prize. I don't like tofu
      and their crispy tofu is one of the best I've ever had.

  <dd>
    <p>
      The Ravenous Pig is quite simply the best restaurant in Orlando. I think I
      discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropub">gastropub</a> concept
      through it. The idea is simple: great drinks and great food in the same place.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Frenchman it was really nice to discover a place in Orlando where
      you could clearly feel the French influences.
      That means great charcuterie (cold cuts) and cheese platters in to start the meal,
      but also their own twist on pub fare like avocado rock shrimp tacos, and the
      best salad I've ever had in the word: the Farmer (bitter greens, soft bacon chunks,
      parmesan flakes, brioche croutons, vinaigrette and a perfectly soft boiled egg sliced
      on top, *swoon*).
    </p>

    <p>
      Their drinks are serious business too. You should definitely try their house
      old-fashioned (bacon-infused buffalo trace bourbon) and other cocktails. I'm
      not a beer specialist but they carry great brews, and I can attest that their
      wine list is solid as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      But about the serious eats? They're amazing. Between the Pork Porterhouse,
      the marinated flat-iron steak frites, there's a regularly changing cast of
      delicious plates prepared with clear attention to detail when it comes to
      sourcing, preparation, and presentation. It's far from cheap, the flat-iron
      steak frites is $25 at lunch or dinner and the farmer salad is $12 but it's
      worth taking a bite out of your budget.

  <dd>
    <p>
      While The Ravenous Pig decidedly has an American-European bent to it, Cask
      is a place closer to what one might expect to find in the Southern US. It's a
      sister restaurant to the Pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the best introduction to the restaurant is the Sunday brunch because you get to test
      an array of creatively delicious bakery and pastry items and at the same time you can sample some of their serious dinner
      food in brunch-friendly format: coffee-rubbed steak, pig muffin, chicken &amp;
      waffle, ribeye hot dog, double stack pork burger.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compete Ravenous Pig's perfect Farmer salad, Cask's Kale salad is a serious
      contender. It's massive (although you can order a half-portion) with delicious
      avocado, granola, apples, and bacon vinaigrette.
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost forgot the drinks. Cask &amp; Larder has their own brewmaster(s)
      and the brewery is right inside the restaurant (you can
      even eat inside of it if your party's too big for the other tables or if you
      sign up for the dream-like Whole Cookery Dinner). Most of the beers served are
      house brews and you can even try a flight of them. Bar-side things are just
      as serious as the big sister with a very competent staff serving my favorite
      cocktails in town (well, ok, Hanson's is in a league of its own) including the
      simply perfect Back To Mezcali (sombra mezcal, aperol, house grapefruit shrub,
      celery bitters, lemon). Yeah, you want to come thirsty here too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally let's talk about desserts. Too many menu bottoms are filled with boring triple-decker
      chocolate cakes with no flavor, the necessary cheesecake and an uninspired
      peanut butter combo. Although Cask' dessert menu varies weekly or monthly
      like the rest, there's often an impressive display of daring and varied stuff.
      Some of my all-time favorite include a three-chocolate mousse "bomb" cake with
      a solid dome-shaped crust, and the delicious chocolate-strawberry cake pictured
      above.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="http://krestaurant.net/">K Restaurant</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Although K's menu is a bit too static, what they serve is often downright
      excellent. The egg plant parmesan is great even if you're not a vegetarian
      because it will make you understand how one can possibly survive
      without meat — even though it must be torturous.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the dinner side, I really like their Duck Breast and Ricotta Gnochi
      although I don't believe in "pea-style carbonara". They could almost
      convince me that it deserves to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their cheese board is from La Femme du Fromage (whose name is actually Tonda
      and who you should seek out at East End Market) so that's something
      you should try. And please, if you're going to red drink wine, pair it
      with cheese and red meat, otherwise you've never tasted wine.

    <p>
      There's a healthy array of Thai restaurants in Orlando but in a few years
      in town, none has impressed me as much as SEA (South East Asian) Thai. The
      plate presentation, the taste and the quality of service are all top notch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure, it's in a strip mall on the side of Colonial Drive (SR50) and the
      outside is plastered with reviews and awards in the least classy way possible,
      but once you get inside you discover a subtly decorated and dimly lit little
      restaurant with a few booths and tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like their Tom Kha (coconut milk) soup although it's not groundbreaking.
      The Phad Thai is delicious, so is the Red Curry, and I can't resist
      the Panang Duck, and the Pineapple Duck Curry. Yes, it's cliché but
      if there's any space left try their Thai Donuts, they're great.

    <p>
      It's shameful how long it took me to finally try Prato and I wasn't
      disappointed. They make and serve the best pasta I've had in a long
      time. Their egg bucatini is a goddamn dream, and I hope you'll find
      it on their ever changing menu of glutten wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood-fired oven pizza made on the premises is not the best
      Neapolitan-style you'll find anywhere but as far as I know it's the
      best and only in town. Go with the Margherita or Widowmaker (caciocavallo,
      romesco, fennel sausage, farm egg), especially if you come by for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their bar however is a bit disappointing. While refreshing and somewhat
      suited to the sunny italian fare, their cocktails are a bit too weak
      for my taste. Take your drinking to Cask & Larder nearby or drive
      over to Hanson's Shoe Repair on Pine Street.

      They always have good beer, often good music, and always some
      delicious hearty (but not only) food, even late.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorites include the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho, and their Duck Lovers
      pizza. The Smiling Bison Burger is good, but not as great as it should
      be to bear their name considering how neat the place is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch out though, they often get packed and the place isn't that big.
      Parking can be tricky too.

    <p>You'll have to drive a bit to the Chinese market past Pine Hills (
    yes, Pine Hills, deal with it) on 50 but if you need a Ramen fix
    Sapporo will help. Their Tonkotsu broth is much too mild for my taste
    now that I've tried more serious stuff but they make a very decent Shoyu
    (soy-based), Shio (salt-based) and Miso ramen. Their Curry Udon is also
    particularly great during the few cold weeks in Orlando.</p>
