One of the things I missed the most from France (and Paris) was the
"Sandwich Parisien". A really basic ham and cheese sandwich on a fresh
half-baguette. Thanks to Benjamin's I can ease that craving whenever I want
now. They make the absolute best baguette in town and it's not a close call.

They also have great quiches. While you can try any of them you should
start with the classic Quiche Lorraine (with bacon bits). The French family
that runs the show is from Bordeaux, and as you should expect they make
delicious local specialties called Canel√© which you should try.

If you're coming for lunch, just look over at the "Rustic Sandwiches" list
and pick a combination that you like, but I beg you, tell them not to toast
your sandwich. If it was up to me, I wouldn't
allow people to toast anything else than the inside of a baguette, and only
very lightly.
