This is something I've only discovered recently since they now have a home
base at the East End Market in Audubon Park. Their French Baguette is miles
better than what Publix passes as a baguette but I would rather recommend their
excellent "pains". In France, "pains" are larger round loafs of bread that
generally don't use white dough. Pain au Levain (Sourdough) is one of their
best. I also recommend their lovely Ciabatta rolls. Don't be afraid to explore,
I can't think of another local bakery with such a wide selection.
