Although Audubon Park was already an interesting neighborhood, P is for Pie
is the cherry on top. They sell lovely little pies and althouhg it's not a
marquee offering, great coffee â€” Portland's Stumptown. I was happy to
discover they served Stumptown's Cold Brew bottles which paired quite well
with their delicious Strawberry basil pie.
