There are no better French pastries in Orlando. Accept no imitators.
Bear in mind, however, that great pastry chefs are not necessarily great
bakers. The Quiche Lorraine and Croque Madame are also great.

My personal recommendation would be the lemon and apple Normandy tarts.
All the other wet pastries are safe bets even if the dry pastries (croissant,
pain au chocolat, etc.) are not the best.
