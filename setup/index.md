**This setup is very likely not for you unless you want a new hobby**. 

If you're dreaming of an unfussy remote communication setup, it isn't 
here yet, but the best tips I can offer are documented in High Fidelity 
Remote Communication's [Hardware Recommendation section][hfrc].

### Lights

[Elgato Key Light Air][9] with:
  - one key light at a 25 degree angle to the right of my face
  - one fill light pointed at the background or left side of my face

### Camera

[Sony A6000 mirrorless camera][8] with: 
  - battery power adapter
  - [Sony 50mm F1.8 OSS Portrait Lens][6]
  - [Elgato Cam Link 4K][7] (set to 1080p 60 fps) 
  - articulated wall-mounted boom arm
  - when reading pre-written slides for screencasts I also use a rudimentary teleprompter called a Padcaster that reflects the screen of my iPhone in front of the lens of the camera allowing me to make eye contact with the viewer

### Voice

[Shure SM7B][10] XLR dynamic microphone with:
  - [Motu M2][4] XLR to USB interface with live digital level monitoring
  - [Cloudlifter CL-1][3] inline amplifier for a "clean" 25 dB boost
  - [RODE PSA1][5] articulated boom arm which allows me to constantly adjust the microphone to the ideal position

### Monitor

[LG 34" 21:9 UltraWide 5K2K Nano IPS LED Monitor with HDR 600 (34WK95U-W)][lg] 
which is a mouthful and happens to be the only high quality IPS panel that 
isn't produced manufactured by Apple (with LG parts), and cost the obscene 
fortune of a near-reference display like the [Pro XDR Display][xdr]. Don't 
get me wrong, I wish I could have that monitor, but I might have to settle 
for a [Studio Display][studio] whenever Apple daigns to produce a 32 or 34" 
model. 

Notably, I currently use the Thunderbolt 3 *input* port on the monitor 
to connect my work laptop and the DisplayPort routed through a [CalDigit 
TS3+ hub][caldigit] and into my home [M1 Mac Mini][m1].

### Speakers

For years I was content with cheap Logitech "computer" speakers (as if 
that's a thing) because there were few quality alternatives that used 
USB (bluetooth for audio is a no) and worked well (OS-level sound controls)
without constant adjustements while providing a rich non-tinny sound. 

I sprung for my first pair of AudioEngine speakers when I was back in 
France in 2014 and never looked back, except for the bass. I first went 
with the [A2+][a2] but upgraded in 2019 to the [HD3][books] since they 
come in a gorgeous (and not cheap looking) walnut finish. Roughly two 
years later I finally spring for the [compatible subwoofer][sub] which 
seemed like a wasteful expense until I played the first song on them.

As an added bonus, the subwoofer makes me feel like people are a bit more 
present on remote work calls when they use halfway decent microphones.

### Computer

For my office desktop I've used Mac minis for years, the first one being 
a 2018 Mac mini (Intel), and gleefully since 2021 an [M1 Mac mini][m1] with 
2 TB of SSD storage and 16 GB of unified memory which occasionally feels
a bit constricting for my diggressive ways but is extremely snappy for 
such a tiny machine.

### Accessories

My trusty [CalDigit TS3 Plus][ts3] is starting to show its age with the 
advent of HDR and a dire need for more USB-C connectivity (which often 
just isn't supported by computers due to bandwidth and power restrictions)
but it allows me to have all of these plugged into one unit: 
- USB-A: 
  - Elgato CamLink
  - AudioEngine HD3 
  - Motu M2
- USB-C: 
  - Thunderbolt 3 USB-C input to Mac mini
  - [Thunderbolt 3 output to monitor](#monitor)
  - LaCie 2big External Hard Drive (Thunderbolt 3)
  - LaCie Rugged with Thunderbolt 2 to 3 (USB-C) adapter
