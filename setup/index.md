Version 1.0 (October 2021)

I strongly recommend against going this route for 99% of people but here is my setup for the nerdiest among you, I [recorded a demo][11] when I first set it up although some of the setup has changed since and I'll likely update this with a more succinct video soon.

### Lights

[Elgato Key Light Air][9] with:
  - one key light at a 25 degree angle to the right of my face
  - one fill light pointed at the background or left side of my face

### Camera

[Sony A6000 mirrorless camera][8] with: 
  - battery power adapter
  - [Sony 50mm F1.8 OSS Portrait Lens][6]
  - [Elgato Cam Link 4K][7] (set to 1080p 60 fps) 
  - articulated wall-mounted boom arm
  - when reading pre-written slides for screencasts I also use a rudimentary teleprompter called a Padcaster that reflects the screen of my iPhone in front of the lens of the camera allowing me to make eye contact with the viewer

### Voice

[Shure SM7B][10] XLR dynamic microphone with:
  - [Motu M2][4] XLR to USB interface with live digital level monitoring
  - [Cloudlifter CL-1][3] inline amplifier for a "clean" 25 dB boost
  - [RODE PSA1][5] articulated boom arm which allows me to constantly adjust the microphone to the idea position
