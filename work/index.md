### Code School
I work remotely as a Tech Lead on [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s
Platform team where I build and maintain the Ruby on Rails application
that powers [codeschool.com](http://codeschool.com).

Throughout the years I've been responsible for upgrading our Rails
infrastructure from version 3.1 to 5.0; maintaining our security bug
bounty; and course building and maintaining billing, team management,
and authorization features for the platform.

I've also worked with our content team to produce interactive challenges
for several courses, and contributed to the development of Code School
Projects which allow students to complete step-by-step tasks on their
own machines or on GitHub while receiving interactive feedback about
their progress along the way.

Several years ago, when Code School was still a baby startup I wrote
and taught in several of our excellent interactive courses:

#### [Try Git](http://try.github.com)

I wrote this short course with the Code School and GitHub teams. We
reproduced a command line terminal to execute real git commands and
produce output in order to help people quickly become familiar with git
without being intimidated. Try Git was released on July 4th, 2012 and
announced by [GitHub on their blog][1]. It has attracted over 5 million
unique visitors since.

#### [Testing with RSpec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)

This was my first Code School course as an on-camera instructor. I
learned most of what I know about RSpec while working on this course.

#### [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)

My second Code School course as a teacher. It visually and interactively
explains the concepts of staging, remote repositories, branching, and
especially rebasing.

### Open Source

Over the years I've regularly created and maintained my own open source
projects and contributed to several popular projects.

### Podcasting
#### [Ruby Facets](http://rubyfacets.com)
A spiritual successor to Ruby5 since it ended, Ruby Facets is a short and sweet
Ruby news podcast that covers new releases, interesting blog posts, and relevant
events in the Ruby and Rails community.

#### [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)
I first started podcasting with Gregg Pollack and the rest of the
Envy Labs & Code School team that rotates on the show. Over time I've
become a regular co-host, until the show [ended on September 20th, 2016](https://ruby5.codeschool.com/episodes/690-episode-645-september-20th-2016).
