### Open Source

Over the years I've regularly created and maintained my own open source
projects and contributed to several popular projects.

### Podcasting
#### [Ruby Facets](http://rubyfacets.com)
A spiritual successor to Ruby5 since it ended, Ruby Facets was a short, sweet,
and short-lived Ruby news podcast that covered new releases, interesting blog
posts, and relevant events in the Ruby and Rails community.

#### [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)
I first started podcasting with Gregg Pollack and the rest of the
Envy Labs & Code School team that rotated on the show. Over time I
became a regular co-host, until the show ended on September 20th, 2016.
