## Code School
I work remotely on [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s Internal
team. There, I maintain and build features for [codeschool.com](http://codeschool.com) along with
other little things that keep me up at night.

In the past I've written and participated in the development
of several of our courses.

## Code School Courses
### [Try Git](http://try.github.com)
I wrote the prose for this short course with a lot of
help from the rest of our team and [Matthew McCullough](https://twitter.com/matthewmccull).

We tried to keep the scope of this project small since most people don't like or
are afraid of using the command line. We reproduced a shell (thanks to
[Adam Rensel](https://twitter.com/adamrensel)'s hard work) that would
execute git commands and produce realistic output.

I still remember when we released this on July 4th, 2012 and
[GitHub announced it on their blog](https://github.com/blog/1183-try-git-in-your-browser).
I had to scale the Heroku dynos for the course from my bed using
[Nezumi](http://nezumiapp.com/) because I could tell we were starting to
be slammed with visitors.

### [Testing with RSpec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)
This was the first Code School course I ever had to teach in front of a
camera, and that along was more than a little bit stressful.
Aside from some limited exposure, I learned most of what I know about
RSpec while working on this course. I also received a lot of useful advice
from people like [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com)' [Nathaniel Bibler](https://twitter.com/nbibler)
who had written and taught our previous testing course: Rails Testing for Zombies.

### [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)
My second Code School course as a teacher. Although I didn't participate
much in the writting, I spent a lot of time working on the slides with
Gregg Pollack to make sure we properly presented the concepts of staging,
remote repositories, branching, and especially rebasing.

The Tron-inspired design and illustrations that Justin Mezzell
created for this course, aside from being gorgeous, helped quite a bit by
allowing us to identify some concepts — through iconography for instance.

[Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real),
[Try jQuery](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery),
and some super sneaky secret internal tools.

## Open Source
### [Shields](https://github.com/badges/shields)
I created [Shields](http://shields.io) in January 2013 in a bout of constructive rage against bad open source repository metadata badges. I'm a bit amazed by how shiny that rage diamond turned out to be.

Thanks to the amazing work of the community (I had very little to do
with it), we now have an [awesome API](http://shields.io/) that can
[generate Retina-grade SVG badges on the fly](http://img.shields.io/badge/how%20cool-is%20that%3F-yellowgreen.svg).

### [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com)
One fatelul day in May 2014 I decided I'd had enough trying to decipher the Git commits from one of my application's dependencies. The dependency in question wasn't some obscure repository. It was something likely used by thousands of people, and yet it didn't have a proper CHANGELOG to speak off. Instead the maintainers did a git log diff between two version tags and dropped that into something they called a "CHANGELOG".

That wasn't a CHANGELOG. A CHANGELOG is a thing for humans who already know how to make a git log diff if they need to. But they don't want to because git log diff are utterly useless to understand what has changed in a release at a high level. This frustration led me to write down what I believe are guidelines for a human-friendly CHANGELOG.

### [Orientation](http://orientation.io)
In late 2012, after nearly a year of working at Code School, I noticed that while
our team was growing, certain questions kept being asked to the same people over
and over again. Being an early member of the team, I had to repeatedly explain
simple things that weren't necessarily related to code, but often spun out to
include company traditions, vacation policies, our customer support philosophy,
etc.

Orientation was born out of the desire to concentrate as much knowledge as possible
in a single point of entry that did not create interruptions for our small team,
allowing us to remain as focus as possible; collaborating when it's necessary
and not to answer a single question. The idea was that people would go to Orientation
first — the same way web developers tend to go to Stack Overflow — before giving up
and asking for help. Better, I wanted to make the act of documenting something
easy enough for anyone to participate in: if you have a question not answered by
Orientation, simply create a new article with that question as the title and send
the URL to the team or the person you believe holds your answer. Instead of answering
one person at a time, this allows knowledge holders to release that knowledge from
the sillo of their brain. It's better for them because they'll be less interrupted,
and it's better for the team because knowledge is not concentrated in single
individuals who may have a meeting, go on vacation, or leave the company with that
knowledge still stored in their head.

It took me three years to finally open-source Orientation and I'm incredibly glad
I did because the influx of excitement and participation has allowed some great
feature like article subscription to be added. It allows every single person who
relies on a piece of information to be notified when an article is updated, creating
hyperlinks of sort between mostly static information and the people who depend on it.

## Podcasting
### [The Multilogue](http://themultilogue)
I met Anthony Colangelo when we were both students at Full Sail University in 2010. I've always loved having deep conversations with him on the phone. And one day we decided to start recording these conversations. The Multilogue was born.

We don't do much editing but record on quality audio hardware so that you don't have to suffer our rants while your ears beg for mercy. It's called The Multilogue because I tend to monologue quite a bit and Anthony can hold his own too. That said, I believe we often arrive at thoughtful conversations about topics we care about: technology, attention to details, self-expression, open source software, iOS development, responsive design, impostor syndrome, etc.

### [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)
I first started podcasting with Gregg Pollack and the rest of the
Envy Labs & Code School team that rotates on the show. Recently I've
become a regular co-host. With the help of serious audio engineering
friends like Jamison Rabbe, Jason Madsen and John Friskics

### [5 Minutes of JavaScript](http://five-js.envylabs.com/episodes/27-episode-27-may-15th-2014)
Recently Carlos Souza [invited me to co-host](http://five-js.envylabs.com/episodes/27-episode-27-may-15th-2014) this new Code School podcast
which follows a similar format than Ruby5, but for JavaScript. It was so
much fun I can't wait to be invited again.

### [A Hypothetical Movie Podcast](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/contributors/olivier)
I met Joshua Blount through co-workers and friends at Envy Labs and it
was so great to finally be able to go full cinephile with a bunch of
(sometimes) like-minded folks.

Along my [few contributions](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/contributors/olivier),
[our Django Unchained episode](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/django-unchained) remains my absolute favorite. Utter joy.

### [Parlons Ruby](http://parlonsruby.com/pr008-olivier-lacan/)
Two extremely nice French rubyists — [Fabien Catteau](https://github.com/fcat)
and [Philippe Creux](https://twitter.com/pcreux) — approached me at the
first [TakeOffConf](http://takeoffconf.com/2013) in Lille, France to do
a little interview. It's all in French, but it was the first time someone asked
now how I got to where I was in early 2013, so it holds a chunk of
nostalgia in my heart.

### [An Impolite Podcast](http://www.animpolitepodcast.com/episode/dolphinhorse)
Nice [conversation](http://www.animpolitepodcast.com/episode/dolphinhorse)
with a devout friend about what it basically means to be an atheist.
