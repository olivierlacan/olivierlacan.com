### Platform

    The Code School account dashbord allowed you to track the course you were currently playing, recently earned activity
    or course completion badges, progress on given learning paths, but also find your team dashboard, and other settings.

I served as Tech Lead on [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s
Platform team where I built and maintained the Ruby on Rails application
that powered [codeschool.com](http://codeschool.com).

Throughout the years I've been responsible for upgrading our Rails
infrastructure from version 3.1 to 5.0; maintaining our security bug
bounty; and course building and maintaining billing, team management,
and authorization features for the platform.

I've also worked with our content team to produce interactive challenges
for several courses, and contributed to the development of Code School
Projects which allow students to complete step-by-step tasks on their
own machines or on GitHub while receiving interactive feedback about
their progress along the way.

Several years ago, when Code School was still a baby startup I wrote
and taught in several of our excellent interactive courses:

### [Try Git](http://try.github.com)

    Try Git had a simplified interface which mimicked a terminal window to help people get acclimated to a command line interface like git.

I wrote this short course with the Code School and GitHub teams. We
reproduced a command line terminal to execute real git commands and
produce output in order to help people quickly become familiar with git
without being intimidated. Try Git was released on July 4th, 2012 and
announced by [GitHub on their blog][1]. It has attracted over 5 million
unique visitors since.

### [Testing with RSpec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)

This was my first Code School course as an on-camera instructor. I
learned most of what I know about RSpec while working on this course.

### [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)

My second Code School course as a teacher. It visually and interactively
explains the concepts of staging, remote repositories, branching, and
especially rebasing.
